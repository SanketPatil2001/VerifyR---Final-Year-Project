42621,61566,Savage Beauty: The bizarre beauty of Alexander McQueen,CNN,<strong></strong>Allyssia Alleyne,3/13/2015,2015,3,," (CNN) You would be pressed to find a designer who appealed to the imagination as much as Alexander McQueen.  A favorite with   and fashion editors alike, he was renowned for his Gothic sensibilities, innovative textiles (think shells, horns and hair) and highly conceptual runway shows, as well as his bad boy antics behind the scenes. (Along with the usual drinks, drugs and parties, he once claimed to have stitched profanities into the lining of a jacket for Prince Charles.) Five years after his death, interest in the designer hasn’t waned, least of all in his home town of London, where, starting this month, he’s being commemorated with an extensive, expensive retrospective at the Victoria and Albert Museum.  Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty, a   of the 2011 exhibition at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, summarizes and contextualizes McQueen’s   career through an elaborate display of 244 garments and accessories.  ”Savage Beauty at the VA is the largest and most ambitious fashion exhibition the museum has ever staged,” said curator Claire Wilcox at a press preview. The VA has already sold 70, 000 advanced tickets, and extended the exhibition by two weeks to meet demand. At the Met, Savage Beauty attracted over 660, 000 visitors by the end of its   run, making it one of the museum’s top 10 exhibitions of all time, up there with a King Tut stop in 1978 and a Mona Lisa loan in 1963. The London connection  Bringing Savage Beauty to London can be seen as a ”homecoming,” as it was described by VA director Martin Roth at the press preview, if not an act of repatriation.  The son of cab driver and a school teacher, Alexander ”Lee” McQueen grew up in London’s East End. After dropping out of school at 16, he honed his tailoring skills on Savile Row, graduated with an MA in fashion design from the city’s prestigious Central Saint Martins college, and used the VA’s archives to research his collections.  He once said of London: ”It’s where my heart is, and where I get my inspiration.” That love was largely reciprocated. In 2011, thousands of British devotees petitioned to have Savage Beauty brought to London after its spectacular New York debut. Fashion journalist Melanie Rickey was one of the most vocal proponents. A longtime fan, she has coauthored the upcoming release Inferno: Alexander McQueen (Laurence King) a coffee table book of interviews and images from photographer Kent Baker, which documents March 1996 collection Dante. ”I was agitated because (Savage Beauty) really is meant to be in his hometown,” Rickey says. ”Everything about him is London, so to not have it in London would have been a crime.” Along with hounding the brand’s corporate honchos and the VA itself, Rickey started an online petition to have the exhibition brought to the city, and instigated the Twitter hashtag #BringMcQueenExhibitionHome. ”It’s like the (Elgin) Marbles: They’re probably a lot more powerful in Greece than they are sitting in the British Museum.” Ultimately, such advocacy may have been unnecessary. According to Kate Bethune, senior exhibition research assistant for Savage Beauty, it had been Roth’s ambition to bring the exhibition to London since he assumed the directorship in September 2011. The VA exhibition, which was announced last April, even begins with a newly added London gallery dedicated to McQueen’s roots in the city and his early shows.  Inside Savage Beauty, Curators called on Sam Gainsbury, who produced all of McQueen’s shows from 1996 on, to act as the exhibition’s creative director and bring McQueen’s pieces to life. ”A lot of (McQueen’s) colleagues say he started his collections with the concept of a show,” Bethune says. ”He always wanted people to have a strong reaction to what he was going.” The most theatrical highlights include the Romantic Primitivism gallery, covered with fake bones like an ossuary, and a   room where a Kate Moss hologram floats in a diaphanous dress, trapped in a glass pyramid.  The   Cabinet of Curiosities has 27 screens showing moments of his most imaginative runway shows: women walk on water, a model’s gown is   by robotic arms, a church is converted into a catwalk. But Bethune believes the real draw will be the groundbreaking pieces made from unconventional materials, which blur the line between fashion and art. Fairytale gowns feature throughout and there’s a whole section dedicated to McQueen’s tailoring skills, but it’s the garments made from razor clam shells, pheasant feathers, and synthetic hair or embellished with impala horns and baby crocodile heads that really standout. The accessories    extravagant headpieces, Swarovski mesh chain mail, impossible shoes    seem like sculptures. ”McQueen was an artist whose medium of expression was fashion,” she says. ”He absolutely changed the way we look at fashion.” Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty runs from March 14   August 2, 2015 at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

42403,61347,"Jeb Bush, White House hopefuls talk hot topic in Iowa",CNN,"<strong></strong>Ashley Killough,<strong></strong>",3/8/2015,2015,3,,"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) For Iowa’s economy, corn is everything. So it’s no surprise that the Republican governor and other powerful voices in state agribusiness are vocal backers of the Renewable Fuel Standard, a federal rule that requires gasoline to be comprised of up to 10% in renewable fuels. One of those is ethanol    with corn often a key ingredient. ”Don’t mess with the RFS,” Gov. Terry Branstad said Saturday, offering a not so subtle warning as he kicked off a daylong agriculture summit that featured a string of likely Republican presidential candidates. The RFS is a major issue that White House hopefuls are forced to address whenever they visit the No. 1   state that also goes first in the presidential nominating calendar.   But it’s a less popular policy for small government conservatives, who decry the mandate as federal overreach in the private sector.  In his first 2016 visit to Iowa, Jeb Bush sought to delicately explain his desire to see the RFS disappear over time. ”The market’s ultimately going to have to decide this,” he told the audience at the event, which took place at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. Bush acknowledged that the mandate, which passed in 2007, has helped lower dependence on foreign oil and boost   economies.  ”But as we move forward over the long haul, there should be certainty for people to invest,” he argued, saying ethanol will no longer need help from the government. ”So at some point we’ll see a reduction of the RFS need, because ethanol will be such a valuable part of the energy feedstock for our country.” He declined, however, to suggest when exactly that may happen.  In his remarks, Bush also defended his position in favor of legal status for undocumented immigrants after they meet a wide set of requirements. And while attending a fundraiser Friday night in Des Moines, he stood by his support for Common Core, the controversial testing standards that have become a point of contention for conservatives.  Election 2016: Jeb Bush makes his first Iowa foray, Bush’s frank statements on the RFS and his defense of some of his most controversial views indicated that the former Florida governor plans on sticking with his positions as he gets ready to hit the campaign trail, no matter how unpopular they may be to certain audiences.  Still, he was not totally immune to at least some pandering. Bush told the crowd that he’ll be cooking some ”Iowa beef” Sunday when he’s back home with his family in Florida, adding that he’ll probably make some ”really good guacamole,” too.  Talking about campaigning for his father’s presidential campaigns in Iowa, Bush said he went to at least 50 counties. ”I remember eating really well    eating really, really well.” Ag issues in the spotlight, With a John Deere tractor towering near the stage, each candidate sat on stage for a   QA with Bruce Rastetter, an agribusiness entrepreneur and major Republican donor in Iowa. The audience of close to 1, 200 was comprised largely of farmers and other leaders in the agriculture industry.  While Bush took a mild approach to the RFS, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas flat out opposed it, saying Washington shouldn’t be ”picking winners and losers.”  ”I have every bit of faith that businesses can continue to compete and continue to do well without having to go on bended knee asking for subsidies, asking for special favors,” he said. ”I think that’s how we got in this problem to begin win.” Ethanol proponents argue that because oil companies own gas stations, consumers are unable to access ethanol and therefore it needs the government’s support to break through oil’s stronghold of the market.  Cruz acknowledged that his view wouldn’t be   but tried to argue that it proved his authenticity.  ”Look, I recognize that this is a gathering of a lot of folks who the answer you’d like me to give is, ’I’m for the RFS, darn it.’ That’d be the easy thing to do. But I’ll tell ya, people are pretty fed up, I think, with politicians that run around and tell one group one thing, tell another group another thing.” Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry took a similar stance and defended his decision to request a waiver that would exempt Texas from the federal mandate. If individual states want to require that ethanol be used in gasoline, that’s fine, he said, but not the federal government.  ”I philosophically don’t agree that Washington, D. C. needs to be making these decision that affect . .. our agriculture industry,” Perry said.  ’We better suck up to them’  Other contenders offered entirely opposite positions. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for example, said he ”absolutely” supports the RFS.  ”That’s what the law requires. So let’s make sure we comply with the law. That should be the minimum,” he said, drawing applause from the crowd.   Rick Santorum, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2012, ticked off what he called a ”laundry list” of benefits, including more energy independence and more jobs for farmers.  ”It is very important for rural Americans,” said the former senator from Pennsylvania.  For his part, Mike Huckabee argued that the ethanol mandate was a matter of national security.  ”America needs to do three things to be free: feed itself, fuel itself, fight for itself,” the former Arkansas governor said, adding that relying on foreign governments for energy leads to a weakened United States.  Huckabee, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2008, hit back at criticism that politicians like him simply support the RFS for political reasons.  ”The decisions are made not just frankly for what’s best for Iowa    that’s not the rationale. You can’t make a decision and say, ’It’s good for Iowa. Gee, they’re the caucus state, we better suck up to them.’ We better make decisions that are good for every consumer,” he said.  Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who’s had a strong showing in polls since he visited the state in January, made clear that while he’s generally a free market guy, he believes ethanol is being blocked from consumers and needs government assistance.  ”Right now, we don’t have a free and open marketplace, and so that’s why I’m willing to take that position,” he said.  But, similar to Bush, Walker said that he expects ethanol can one day compete openly and ”you no longer need in the industry to have these subsidies.” The audience at Saturday’s event was largely subdued, given the tone and dialogue of the summit was more substance, less red meat. Those who supported the RFS, however, received a strong response from the crowd.  As for those who opposed it, Bill Couser, who   a campaign called America’s Renewable Future which pushes the ethanol mandate, said he’s not ready to write anyone off quite yet. But those candidates can expect to hear a lot more from him in the coming months.  ”Maybe I didn’t like a few of their answers, but it’s going to give me some time to go help them understand the issues,” he said.

41836,60772,2016 race kicks off with long day of auditions in Iowa,CNN,<strong></strong>Ashley Killough<strong></strong>,1/25/2015,2015,1,,"DES MOINES, Iowa (CNN) The 2016 Republican presidential race in Iowa got its unofficial start Saturday with a marathon of speeches, giving close to a dozen potential candidates a chance to introduce (or  ) themselves to a core group of   roughly one year before the contest. Immigration and Islamic extremism took front and center as the White House hopefuls sought to   their stump speeches. On style, it was Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz who saw strong receptions from the audience, though support for a wide number of candidates was expressed in the hallways after the event. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also sought to establish a deeper bond with Iowa. The Hawkeye State receives outsized attention in presidential years thanks to its     status during the primary season.  Marathon time, For the   day of    speeches, ”the candidates”    as they were called     joined other   Republicans at Hoyt Sherman Place, an old, intricate theater built in 1877 that also became the first public art museum in Des Moines. Billed as the Iowa Freedom Summit, the event was   by Citizens United and Rep. Steve King, a revered lawmaker who represents the northwestern part of the state and has considerable clout among the more social conservative and Christian right faction of the party.  It was no secret that it was considered a cattle call for the presidential race. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, for example, said that the reason he ended his Fox News show was for a bigger goal he has in mind.  ”It wasn’t just so I can go deer hunting every weekend, I can assure you that,” he said.  Others were more blatant.  ”I am a potential presidential candidate, yes I am,” former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina told CNN.  Even Palin angled to get in on some of the action, teasing ahead of her appearance Saturday that she was now seriously considering a run. And real estate titan Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that he’ll make his decision before June.  ”I’m the one person who can make this country great again, that’s all I know,” he told reporters Saturday. ”Nobody else can.” Palin, in her remarks, was less forward. Ticking through a somewhat dizzying and    speech, Palin suggested that the country is ready for a woman leader    just not Hillary Clinton.  ”Hey Iowa, can anyone stop Hillary?” she said, prompting the audience to cheer. ”To borrow a phrase, yes we can!” The class of 2016, The speakers, who were typically allotted 20 minutes, used a bulk of their speeches to share their own personal upbringings. Ben Carson and Christie talked about their strict but sharp mothers, while Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz talked about having pastors as fathers. Other more   names in Iowa  —   like former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum who won the state’s caucuses in 2012 and Huckabee, who won in 2008  —   tried to remind Iowans why they picked them in the first place, dipping into their personalities but also focusing on the issues.  Given King’s firebrand credentials as an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration, it was no surprise that problems at the border became a focal point in much of the speeches Saturday.  Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, argued ”there wouldn’t be people coming in here if there wasn’t a magnet pulling them in,” suggesting there should be criminal punishment for employers who hire undocumented workers.  The main target in the immigration battle, however, was President Barack Obama’s executive action to delay deportation for up to five million undocumented immigrants. Or as Palin put it, in her folksy swagger, Obama’s decision makes him seem ”like an overgrown little boy who’s just acting kinda spoiled.” Speakers railed against the President’s pledge to use his ”pen and his phone” to work around Congress, with immigration as just one example of what many called the president’s ”overreach.” That was punctuated when DREAM Act Coalition protesters interrupted Rick Perry’s speech, leading to one arrest and theater full of Iowans trying to drown out the demonstrators’ chants.  The potential candidates also warned about what they see as a dire path for the country, in particular when it comes to foreign policy, a theme that, along with immigration, also seems poised to become a flash point in the 2016 presidential race, unlike in 2012.  Santorum argued that the growth of ISIS is a consequence of the ”isolationism” and ”weakness” from the Obama’s administration. Cruz, like several speakers, said the President will fail in the war on terror if he refuses to use the words ”radical Islamic terrorism.” Huckabee blasted Obama for devoting more time to climate change in the State of the Union address than talking about terrorism.  ”A beheading is a far greater threat to Americans than a sunburn,” Huckabee said.  The issues, There was plenty of the usual Iowa charm on stage, speeches with pig analogies and corn references. And there was more than one reference to how people in Iowa are somehow taller than average.  Shown on a big screen above the stage was an image of a red barn sitting on a green hill surrounded by white fences. Steve King’s name  —   in all caps  —   was plastered across banners on the stage, as well as the podium. The contenders also dished out a bevy of red meat, blasting Obamacare, Common Core, the media, Hillary Clinton and the $18 trillion debt. Cruz won huge applause for proposing to place 110, 000 IRS employees on the southern border, joking that they’ll do a better job at deterring illegal immigration than anything else.  Giving a shout out to the state’s newly elected U. S. senator, Joni Ernst, was also a popular item on the agenda for the potential candidates. Nearly all of them referred to her as their ”friend,” and almost equal amount of affection and time was dedicated to the state’s other beloved senator, Chuck Grassley.  Walker, who, like Cruz, paced the stage back and forth as he spoke, delivered an impressive speech that honed in on his record as governor. He talked about implementing voter ID laws, and he painted himself as the valiant warrior who took on the public employees and won during the collective bargaining rights debate of 2011.  He also didn’t forget to mention that he’s been elected three times in the past four years.  Shortly after his speech, two men, both from Council Bluffs, talked outside about how they were wowed by Walker’s remarks.  ”If he could do on a nationwide scale what he did in Wisconsin, this country would be,” one man, Michael Patomson, started to say, before his friend, Bill Hartzell, interjected: ”Transformed. The country would be transformed.”  The reception, Many attendees had a hard time picking just one favorite in the line of potential contenders. Several mentioned Fiorina as a surprise hit.  ”There was just a pantheon of people to listen to,” said Eric Rosenthal of Cedar Rapids.  ”Rick Perry was better than last time I heard him  —   that’s good. He needs it,” said Ernie Rudolph of Dallas County, Iowa.  Christie also saw a warm reception and contested the idea that a Republican governor of a blue state who has a ”Jersey guy” reputation will not connect with voters in Iowa.  ”That somehow I’m too loud, I’m too blunt and I’m too direct,” Christie said, dismissing the criticism as ”conventional wisdom” from Washington pundits. ”They’re wrong.” Still, he was noticeably different from his usual style. His demeanor was toned down and he read from his prepared remarks on the podium, a stark contrast to his preferred    method.  Some of the chatter in the hallways and to reporters also featured two potential contenders who weren’t there: Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney.  Trump put it simply: ”Mitt had his chance. He should have won and he choked.” As for Bush: ”We’ve had enough of the Bushes.”  Sens. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, as well as Gov. Bobby Jindal, also skipped the event, but given that it’s year ahead before Iowans start to caucus, it’s unlikely that missing one event will hurt them.  Saturday’s event was more of a curtain raiser, giving the first glimpse of what will likely be a competitive Republican primary.  Walker, as he closed his speech, offered a pledge that will likely be mirrored by several of the speakers on stage over the next year: ”I’m going to come back many more times.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42624,61569,It’s not over: Veterans waiting months for appointments,CNN,<strong></strong>Drew Griffin<strong></strong>,3/14/2015,2015,3,,"Los Angeles (CNN) Thousands of veterans who are patients at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System have been waiting months just for an appointment, CNN has learned.  What’s more, administrators in charge of the massive VA facility in greater Los Angeles may have been hiding wait times, and may have misled Congress on the delays and exactly how long veterans are being forced to wait for care, according to new information obtained by CNN.   This revelation means that the scandal over delays in care and wait times for veterans, which embroiled the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs last year and even led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, is apparently not over. And the changes promised by the VA and the Obama administration may not be working. The detailed new evidence comes from the Los Angeles VA’s own internal documents obtained by CNN, and numerous medical and administrative sources confirmed the information.  It is particularly significant as the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Medical Center is the nation’s largest VA health care system, caring for hundreds of thousands of U. S. veterans.  The VA documents show more than 12, 700 appointments, which the VA calls consults, had been waiting more than 90 days to be addressed, as of  .  Even new patients seeking care at the Los Angeles VA for the first time can wait months to see a doctor there. Records show on January 15, more than 1, 600 veterans who were new patients were waiting 60 to 90 days for appointments. Another 400 veterans have waited up to six months, and 64 veterans had been waiting six months to a year for their appointments. The documents provided to CNN show the lengthy wait times are still happening, within the last several months, and sources say the backlog is happening even now.  And yet last month, the VA’s acting director for the Western region overseeing the Los Angeles VA told Congress that veterans who are new patients there only have to wait a few days for appointments. ”The average wait time for a new patient right now is about four days,” Dr. Skye McDougall, the acting director of the Desert Pacific Healthcare Network, Veterans Health Administration, testified before the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. But McDougall’s statement is simply not true.  According to the Los Angeles VA’s documents dated January 15, the actual average wait time for new patients at the VA was 48 days. A   medical and administrative sources inside the LA VA system corroborate these waits.  The wait times since then have not changed significantly    coming down slightly to a wait time of 44 days for new patients as of March 1, according to another VA document    and are still roughly 10 times what McDougall testified they were. The delays in appointments are even taking place at Los Angeles clinics for mental health, where documents show more than 300 veterans have been waiting more than 30, 60, even 90 days for treatment. At the congressional hearing, McDougall was specifically asked about mental health wait times for new patients, a growing national concern as hundreds of veterans are committing suicide every year.  The uncounted: War’s true toll, Asked how long the wait time is for mental health at the Los Angeles VA, McDougall testified that the same number    a four days’ wait for new patients    applies for mental health.  But that is also not true, according to the documents and sources inside the VA who spoke with CNN.  A new LA VA chart shows as of March 1, new mental health patients in Los Angeles are waiting an average 36 days just to get an appointment.  Los Angeles VA officials would not talk to CNN about the discrepancies but instead sent a statement saying that the ”Greater Los Angeles and VA nationwide continues to work very hard to get Veterans off waiting lists and into clinics to get the care they have earned and deserve.”  The VA sent CNN new ”retrospective data” showing primary care average wait times of four days, specialty care wait times of 7. 5 days, and mental health wait times of 2. 5 days, as of January. The VA explained that the chart for new patients obtained by CNN ”does not include same day appointments or in some cases same week appointments for those Veterans who need care quickly. ...”  New patients, the VA told CNN, ”typically account for less than 10% of all Veteran appointments and are not representative of the whole patient population.”    Despite the ”retrospective data,” the real truth, say the sources CNN has interviewed, is reflected in the internal LA VA documents obtained by CNN    that wait times for many patients at the Los Angeles VA Medical Centers extends into weeks and months and are a serious problem. This news of continuing delays in Los Angeles comes a year after reports of   and turmoil at the VA, which became a national scandal, where wait times, veterans’ deaths and even secret waiting lists were revealed at VA hospitals across the country.  Congress even passed a new law last fall to help veterans get care more quickly, as a direct result of the scandal. And since the scandal, Congress has approved $16 billion extra for the VA in an attempt to hire more doctors and nurses and to build more facilities. The VA removed its   scheduling goal to discourage engaging in ”inappropriate scheduling practices,” and President Barack Obama also appointed a new VA secretary, Robert McDonald, last summer. Vets not impressed with VA reforms, Sources in the Greater Los Angeles VA say despite the scandal last year, the new secretary, the new laws and all the attention, not much has changed.

42598,61543,North Korean envoy apologizes after gold incident,CNN,<strong></strong>Ivan Watson,3/12/2015,2015,3,,"New Delhi, India (CNN) The North Korean ambassador in Bangladesh issued an apology after one of the embassy’s diplomats was caught carrying 27 kilograms (59 pounds) of undeclared gold into the country’s main airport in Dhaka, according to officials in Bangladesh.  North Korean officials could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile, state media in the largely isolated communist country has not yet reported on the incident. Kazi Muhammad Ziauddin, a top official in Bangladesh’s customs agency, told CNN his officers discovered the gold on the afternoon of March 5th, after the diplomat arrived on a Singapore Airlines flight. Ziauddin said customs officials had received a confidential tip that a North Korean diplomat would be carrying ”illegal items.” ”It was very tough. We have to be very careful and sensitive when we deal with a diplomat,” Ziauddin said, referring to the Vienna Convention, which affords diplomats certain degrees of consular immunity. Bag searched, He said the suspect, whom he identified as Son Young Nam, the first secretary of North Korea’s embassy in Dhaka, initially refused to allow his baggage to be searched. ”He said there is no way we can open or scan his bag,” Ziauddin said. ”At first he said ’This is an electric motor.’  After further questioning he changed his mind and told us, ’These are cipher machines and very confidential. ’” Eventually, customs officers opened the diplomat’s bag and found the undeclared goods, that included 170 gold bars and golden ornaments. At current market prices, the gold would be valued at around $1 million. Entering Bangladesh without declaring this quantity of precious metal is a violation of the country’s customs regulations.  An official with Bangladesh’s Foreign Secretary, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity, said his government lodged a protest with the North Korean ambassador.  North Korea sanctions, It’s far too early to jump to conclusions about whether the alleged gold smuggling incident could be an isolated example of corruption or an effort to move official funds. Due to international sanctions, North Korea faces substantial obstacles when trying to access international banking systems.  ”It would be interesting to see if [the diplomat] is disciplined when he gets back” to North Korea, said John Delury, associate professor at Yonsei University’s Graduate School of International Studies. ”That would be a way of saying whether or not he’s a corrupt diplomat.”  According to the Foreign Secretary’s office in Bangladesh, the North Korean diplomat allegedly caught carrying the gold has since left the country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43437,62386,"How the Philippines saved 1,200 Jews during Holocaust",CNN,<strong></strong>Madison Park,2/3/2015,2015,2,," (CNN) Even at the age of 7, Lotte Hershfield knew her world was crumbling. She avoided the benches with the sign: No dogs or Jews allowed. She couldn’t attend public schools. And the Nazis and their growling German shepherds raided her family’s house, throwing their books into a fire. As a child, ”we were very aware,” said Hershfield, now 84. Jews weren’t welcome in their own home. Growing increasingly fearful, her parents and her older brother left their hometown of Breslau, Germany, in 1938 and journeyed to an unlikely new home    the Philippines. About 1, 200 European Jews fled to the Philippines from 1937 to 1941, escaping the throes of the Nazis only to face another bloody war under Japanese occupation.   Many of the Jews came from Austria and Germany, as the   policies including the Nuremberg race laws intensified. Unable to immigrate to countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, thousands of Jews escaped to places such as Shanghai in China, Sousa in the Dominican Republic and Manila. Those who arrived in Manila didn’t realize that they had escaped the Holocaust only to be caught in the war in the Eastern Front, where the Philippines came under attack.  ”We were going from the frying pan to the fire,” Hershfield said. ”We went from Nazi persecutors to the Japanese.” The Philippines capital was liberated after a grueling, monthlong campaign in the Battle of Manila, one of the bloodiest battles of World War II, which now marks its 70th anniversary.  From persecution to a welcome, This little known chapter of history about Jewish refugees in the Philippines has inspired two documentaries and talk of a possible movie. ”We know about stories like Anne Frank, ’Schindler’s List’    the things that grab popular imagination,” said Michelle Ephraim, whose father, Frank Ephraim escaped to the Philippines after Kristallnacht in 1938. ”Once you bring an Asia element, it becomes so complicated, interesting and surprising.” About 40 of the Philippines refugees are alive today, according to documentary filmmakers. They were children when they arrived in the Philippines over 70 years ago. ”That was like a rebirth,” said Noel Izon, the filmmaker of the documentary, ”An Open Door: Jewish Rescue in the Philippines,” in which he interviewed several Jewish refugees. ”They went from certain death to this life.” Among them was Frank Ephraim, who arrived in Manila at the age of eight. He recounted his experience in his biography, ”Escape to Manila: From Nazi Tyranny to Japanese Terror.” ”My father got a lot of positive attention, coming from a place where Jews were exiled and treated so poorly,” said his daughter, of his escape from Europe. Frank Ephraim died in 2006.  ”The Filipinos were incredibly kind and treated him extremely well. There was an element of something so redemptive.” How the Philippines became a haven, Manuel Quezon, the first president of the Philippine Commonwealth, and a group of Americans that included future U. S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Freiders, the   brothers, became increasingly concerned about the treatment of Jews in Europe during the late 1930s.  ”They had a shared view of the world, they were men who understood what was happening in Europe,” said Russ Hodge,   of the documentary ”Rescue in the Philippines.” That documentary was screened in the Philippines with the country’s president, Benigno Aquino in attendance last year.  Over poker, the men devised a strategy to bring Jewish refugees to the Philippines.   The Philippines Commonwealth remained under U. S. supervision so it could not accept people who would need public assistance. The refuge committee sought highly skilled professionals such as doctors, mechanics and accountants.  By 1938, a stream of refugees arrived including a rabbi, doctors, chemists and even a conductor, Herbert Zipper, who survived Dachau concentration camp and later became the founder of the Manila Symphony.  Quezon’s ambitions to settle 10, 000 Jews in the southern island of Mindanao were dashed as the the war arrived to the shores of the Philippines.  A new home in the tropics, For the European Jews who arrived in the Philippines, ”it was a cultural shock,” said Hershfield. ”We didn’t know the language. We had never seen any other than white people before.” The humidity was thick, the heat overpowering and the mosquitoes gigantic.  But the young Jewish refugees saw the Philippines as a new adventure. Children climbed mango trees, swam in the bay and learned Filipino songs.  Hershfield became friends with local neighbors, played sipa (a local kicking game) and relished tropical fruit such as papaya and guava. Life in Manila was running around in sandals and summer clothes. The experience differed for her parents. ”It was very difficult for my parents,” she said. ”They never really learned Tagalog. They had been westernized and they stayed mostly within their circle of other immigrants.” Many of them lived in crowded community housing where fights would break out. They had gone from being wealthy in Germany to having nothing. ”It wasn’t what they’d known before in Germany,” Izon said. ”At the same time, ”they were able to practice their religion, able to intermingle and have businesses.” Hershfield’s idyllic days of playing under the Manila sun came to an abrupt end as the war came ashore to the Philippines.   Japanese occupation, Starting in 1941, the Japanese occupied the Philippines. In some respects, the Jewish refugees were treated considerably better than Filipinos. What ironically protected the Jews was their German passports with the swastikas    they were viewed as allies.   ”It occurred to me later, that’s what kept us from being interned,” said Ursula Miodowski, who was 7 years old at the time.  The Japanese interned British and American residents in camps. Filipinos and American soldiers were forced to march 65 miles in the infamous Bataan Death March in which an estimated 10, 000 prisoners died.   Japanese officers confiscated residents’ homes and also hoarded crops for its military. The local economy shriveled and food became scarce. Life under the Japanese was hard and brutal, surviving refugees said. When Allied forces began taking back the Philippines, bombs fell daily. Families hid in bomb shelters, not knowing where the next one would fall. Frank Ephraim spent days hiding in a ditch, shaking with a mattress covering his head. One of Hershfield’s friends died after stepping on a mine.  ”Fires were going on all the time,” said Hershfield. ”You could see the black clouds, smell of bodies, lying there and decaying.” As the Japanese were losing Manila, the imperial troops launched a brutal urban campaign. Rapes, torture, beheadings and bayoneting of civilians were widely reported, so much so that a Japanese general Tomoyuki Yamashita was later executed for having failed to control his troops.  ”The Japanese decided to destroy Manila. They were going to give them a dead city, they set about doing that,” said Miodowski. ”They burned, they killed.” But war time in the Philippines was ”preferable to being in a concentration camp,” she said.  The monthlong urban street fighting for Manila left the capital in ashes, decimating its economy and infrastructure. The Philippines suffered nearly a million civilian deaths during the war. Despite the trauma of facing both fronts of the war, Hershfield remains grateful. ”We would not be alive today if not for the Philippines. We would’ve been destroyed in the crematorium.” Refuge remembered, In 2009, a monument honoring the Philippines was erected at the Holocaust Memorial Park in the Israeli city of Rishon Lezion. The monument, shaped like three open doors, thanks the Filipino people and its president for taking in Jewish refugees during the Holocaust. Many of the descendants of the Jewish refugees who fled to the Philippines have not forgotten their family’s place of refuge.  When Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines in November 2013, the disaster brought in relief workers from the American Jewish Distribution Committee.  Danny Pins, who is related to Hershfield and is the son of a Jewish refugee to the Philippines, headed its assessment team.  ”For me it was like coming full circle and I couldn’t help but think of what it must have been like when my grandparents and mother arrived 76 years ago,” he said. ”My going to the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan was very special. I was repaying a debt to the country that saved my family.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44356,63319,Meet Alasdair Howell: The 10-year-old piano prodigy,CNN,"<strong></strong>Neil Curry,<strong></strong>",6/1/2015,2015,6,," (CNN) Playing catch with his dad in the back garden, Alasdair Howell might appear like any other    boy.  But the hands he is using to throw the ball could one day be worth millions.  The child prodigy began playing piano aged three, was performing at London’s prestigious Royal Festival Hall at six, and now barely into   has been named by celebrity pianist Lang Lang as a future star.  ”It is a hobby, but I like it very much and I think it’s part of me,” says Howell, who practices his craft for     to two hours each day. His public performances began before he could easily reach the piano stool, but his composure at the keyboard made a lasting impression on the audience    and Lang.  ”I saw this little baby sitting on the piano, he had hair almost like Chopin’s. He played for me, he was very young. .. and I thought this is a cute boy, and has some potential,” said Lang. Howell’s future lies, literally, in his own hands    and that means taking care of them, even when playing in the garden.  ”We’ve not talked about insuring them,” said Alasdair’s father, Richard. ”I don’t know how practical that will be but I certainly worry about them.”  ”We’ve been ice skating a few times and that just terrifies me, I do worry about his hands and telling him he can’t become a wicket keeper on cricket, he has to be careful with his hands.”  And it’s not just his hands that are feeling the pressure, there are other side effects of being a child star.  ”Once you’re child prodigy, that means your parents and your teacher will probably put more attention on you than some other kid,” explains Lang.  ”When you get a lot of attention it’s a good thing, but it also creates the pressure.”  Lang Lang has become a global superstar through a combination of his breathtaking talent and flamboyant personality.  He is one of the few classical artists today who can frequently pack out concert halls around the world, performing for presidents, prime ministers and a global audience at the Beijing Olympics.  What has become known as the ”Lang Lang effect” inspired millions of Chinese children to take up the piano.  He harbors a passion to pass on his enthusiasm for the instrument and its music to a younger generation through his work as a UNICEF ambassador and his own music foundation. ”When I see those kids playing on stage or in the class I  become emotional because it really takes me back. I really want to help them to achieve their dreams, because I know we had the same dream before.” Young musicians such as Alasdair are underpinning record industry hopes that classical music will defy the pessimists and ensure a bright future for this rich, musical heritage.  ”I think how far Alasdair goes is really going to be up to Alasdair,” says his father, Richard. ”There’s only so much we can do to support him and he’s 10 now, as Lang Lang said, between the ages of 10 and 20 is vital for any musician’s development.”  Watch: The rise of Soweto’s string playing stars, Listen: How classical music is making a comeback",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45292,64264,The Ultimate Back to the Future Quiz,CNN,"<strong></strong>Phoebe Parke,<strong></strong>",6/30/2015,2015,6,," (CNN) Superfans assemble! To mark the 30th anniversary of ”Back to the Future,” we’ve compiled the hardest quiz about the famous film trilogy you’ve probably ever read.  Since it was first released on July 3, 1985, Back to the Future has become one of the most profitable    and beloved    film trilogies of all time, spawning a cartoon series, upcoming theater show, and countless hovercraft prototypes. Over three decades later, the films appear to have lost none of their appeal, with tens of thousands of fans kitting out in their best Marty McFly vests and Doc radiation suits for Secret Cinema’s Back to the Future screening at London’s Olympic Park last year. ”Back to the Future remains popular today because it is a perfectly constructed film born out of a fresh and creative idea,” says Caseen Gaines, author of ’We Don’t Need Roads: The Making of the Back to the Future Trilogy.’ ”The filmmakers were at the top of their game and that shows in every frame of the film.”   Indeed, it feels fitting that a film about time travel has managed to stand the test of, well, time. ”It visually presents the theoretical complexities of time travel    and its consequences    through comedy and warmth, with excellent examples of   and ” says Dr. Sorcha Ní Fhlainn, lecturer in Film Studies and American Literature at Manchester Metropolitan University, who helped put together this very quiz.  ”It is also important because it articulates so much about 1980s culture    Reaganism, upward mobility, the seemingly limitless potential and perils of science and discovery. It updates and modifies the brilliance of H. G Wells’ 1895 novella ’The Time Machine,’ in exciting and culturally specific ways,” added the author of ”The Worlds of Back to the Future: Critical Essays on the Films.” Like many fans, Ni Fhlainn’s devotion runs deep. ”I first saw it on VHS in 1986    it was a film my family watched repeatedly as I grew up and gave me a lifelong love of 1980s American culture and that irresistible dream of time travel that we consistently revisit in science fiction cinema,” she said.

42328,61271,Key moments from Aaron Hernandez trial,CNN,<strong></strong>Susan Candiotti,2/27/2015,2015,2,," (CNN) Two years ago, Aaron Hernandez had a $40 million contract and was a rising NFL star. Now the former New England Patriot is on trial in the killing of Odin Lloyd. Lloyd, a semipro football player, was shot multiple times on June 17, 2013. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty. Here are some of the key moments from the past week of his murder trial: Victim’s sister can talk about the texts, Judge Susan Garsh on Monday reversed her initial ruling to block any mention of multiple texts from Lloyd before he was slain. Lloyd’s sister, Shaquilla Thibou will be able to say she received four texts from her brother just minutes before his death.   The last text came at 3:23 a. m. a minute before workers in the industrial park where Lloyd’s body later was found heard gunshots.  Thibou had been expected to testify Friday, but that testimony was delayed as the court proceedings focused instead on exploring critical cellphone records. Thibou will not be able to talk about the nature of the texts, including this one that prosecutors say was from Lloyd: ”U saw who I’m with. .. Nfl. .. just so u know.” The judge ruled it would be too prejudicial against Hernandez.  Gunshots ’like fireworks going off’ Two plant employees working the overnight shift at Needletech Products Inc. a company in the industrial park where Lloyd’s body was found, reported hearing loud bangs at the time he was thought to have been fatally shot. One worker, Barbara Chan, said she was napping in her car during her lunch break between 3 and 3:30 a. m.  ”I heard a loud band, maybe four or five times,” she testified Monday, saying she thought it was fireworks.  ”It was two slow ones and three fast ones,” she added. Another plant worker, Michael Ribeiro, said he heard about six or eight loud bangs just after 3:20 a. m.  ”A loud banging sound, like fireworks going off,” Ribeiro testified. Prosecutors have presented evidence, including autopsy photos that show Lloyd was shot six times    once in the back, once in the arm, and the rest to his torso. What does the surveillance video show? On Tuesday, during testimony by one of three cleaning ladies in the Hernandez household, prosecutors showed the jury video of Hernandez’s fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, taking a trash bag from the house and placing it in the trunk of her sister’s car.  Her sister, Shaneah Jenkins, was Lloyd’s girlfriend. What might Shayanna Jenkins say? In the video, Shayanna Jenkins appears to walk out the back patio door of the Hernandez home carrying a heavy, black trash bag. At one point, she puts it down and places a pile of clothes into the bag, picks it up again and goes to the garage.  One of the maids, Carla Barbosa, then moves a white van out of the way to clear a path for Jenkins. Jenkins then puts the bag into the trunk of her sister’s car.     Prosecutors allege Jenkins may have been following instructions from Hernandez to get rid of the murder weapon from their home by putting the gun in a black trash bag and borrowing her sister’s car to dispose of the bag in a trash bin.   Prosecutors say that on the day after Lloyd was killed, Jenkins got a coded text message from Hernandez. Hernandez asked Jenkins to get something out of their basement, according to search warrants.     ”Go . .. in back of the screen in movie room when u (sic) get home an (sic) there is a box . .. jus (sic) in case u were looking for it! !! Member (sic) how you ruined the big tv . .. WAS JUST THINKIN bout that lol wink wink love u TTYL. ...K”     TTYL is shorthand for ”talk to you later.”    When Jenkins returned home, she was captured on the same security system, but without the bag. Jenkins told a grand jury she threw it in a trash bin but couldn’t remember where, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors suspect the   murder weapon was inside.   (Jenkins has been granted immunity, compelling her to testify at Hernandez’s trial. She is on the prosecution’s witness list. It is not known whether her testimony will help or hurt Hernandez.) When the defense team questioned Barbosa, she acknowledged she had no idea what was in the trash bag and that it could have been trash. Housekeepers testify about guns, Two other cleaning ladies, Marilia Prinholato and Grazielli Andrade Silva, both testified this week they found guns in the Hernandez home. Silva owns the company responsible for Hernandez’s residence and has also cleaned other Patriots’ players houses,  Silva testified she took a gun from a pair of Hernandez’s pants and showed it to her  . She said she put it back in the pants because she didn’t want anyone to know she had seen it.  Silva also testified to feeling a gun under the mattress in the basement bedroom where Ernest Wallace was staying. Wallace and Carlos Ortiz have also been charged with murder in the death of Lloyd. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. Prinholato said she saw a gun fall out from beneath the mattress of the same bed a month before Lloyd’s killing. Video shows Hernandez dancing shortly before Lloyd’s death, Surveillance video shows Hernandez pulling up to a gas station in his rented silver Nissan Altima at 2 a. m. that June 17, a little more than an hour before Lloyd’s death. Wallace and Ortiz are with him.  The surveillance video was shown in court this week.   Hernandez and Ortiz exit the car. Ortiz is wearing a white towel, which prosecutors say is the same one found at the crime scene. Hernandez dances a few times    once as he walks in front of his car and into the store, where he and Ortiz buy cotton   bubble gum and a box of Black  Mild cigars. A chewed piece of gum was found stuck to a .  shelling in a trash bin at an Enterprise rental car place, a detective said.   Surveillance video shows Hernandez dancing again, pumping his arms in the air as he returns to his car and walks around. The three men leave the gas station at 2:12 a. m. Twenty minutes later, at 2:32 a. m. another surveillance video shows a silver Nissan Altima pull up in front of Lloyd’s house.  Lloyd is waiting outside and gets in the car.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44503,63467,Alex Chinneck’s mind-bending buildings,CNN,<strong>Allyssia Alleyne</strong>,11/25/2014,2014,11,," (CNN) In South London, a   wax house is melting. In the city’s busy Covent Garden shopping piazza, a building floated above the ground. A   walk away, a townhouse is flipped on its head.  No, you’re not hallucinating. These are the most recent irreverent installations from Alex Chinneck, the British artist making a name for himself with   works that appeal to the imagination and beg for a  . For the past year, he’s been achieving this through architecture.  ”Architecture is the fabric and surroundings of our daily and habitual environments,” says Chinneck, 30. ”It provides a very good canvas for creative exploration and abstraction.”  An architectural chapter  When I meet with Chinneck at his psychiatric    in Hackney (seriously) Take My Lighting, But Don’t Steal my Thunder    the polystyrene building floating above Covent Garden    has just been taken down after its   run.  ”It was on the national news in 24 countries that piece, and footfall was up 18 percent in respect to trade and the piazza. So that’s just great,” he says.  Read: 10 works of art that shocked the world, The floating building is part of what Chinneck calls the ”architectural chapter” of his career, which has born four   installations that use the materials, language and shapes associated with the craft. Though he’d previously used construction materials to create small sculptures, he only recently started working on a larger scale, partly inspired by Rachel Whiteread’s House (a concrete mold of a Victorian house that won the Turner Prize in 1993) and the installations of Richard Wilson. ”It just made sense to integrate those creative explorations into an architectural context and scale, back to where they belonged.”  Making the familiar strange  What makes Chinneck’s work distinctive    other than its obvious   properties    is how each one seems both at home and out of place in its surrounding neighborhood. A Pound of Flesh for 50p, built in Southwark as part of Merge Festival, would look like a typical Georgian house were it not made of wax and melting a little more each day. The floating building looks like a part of the    market has just been plucked and suspended in mid air.   Read: The dazzling symmetry of Iran’s mosques, ”I don’t like to disrupt a district too much, so the work is contextually sensitive. The material and visual decisions are informed by the district and the area and the architectural language of that region,” he explains. ”The concepts are extremely considered despite their playfulness and simplicity. They’re tailored to their environment and their audience.”  His installation in Covent Garden, for example, needed to speak to the piazza’s high levels or foot traffic and tourists to please the commissioning landlords.  ”The demographic through the piazza is incredibly eclectic, but it’s very   and recreational. People come and go, take a photo and move on, so the artwork had to deliver an impact for the Instagram generation.” This last phrase seems to sum up his installations well. The pieces are difficult to execute, simple to enjoy and, he insists, free of any particular meaning or concept. The priority is public enjoyment. Conceptually light, sculpturally complex  The response to the floating house, as well as his other works, has been overwhelmingly positive. Along with comments   Chinneck says he regularly receives emails, tweets and links to articles from people who have enjoyed his installations. The owner of a vintage shop near From the Knees of My Nose to the Belly of my Toes, his sliding house in the seaside town of Margate, even gifted him a free suit because of the number of shoppers his installation attracted.  Read: The surreal architecture you wish existed, Though he tries to avoid the usual traps    internet comment sections, namely    Chinneck still receives his share of negative criticism too. He’s grown immune to accusations that his work is pointless, a waste of taxpayers’ money, or, alternately, a waste of private commissioners’ money, but he’s still occasionally frustrated by the assumption that his work is easy or banal because of its simplicity and lack of intellectual intent.   ”I don’t understand at what point the experience needed this intellectual justification to be an important and valuable one,” he says. ”I’m often criticized for this lack of conceptual content.

45344,64317,The psychology of ’organization porn’,CNN,<strong>Allyssia Alleyne</strong>,4/22/2015,2015,4,," (CNN) Emily Blincoe’s Instagram feed is a virtual haven for neat freaks everywhere.   Scroll through, and you’ll find image after satisfying image of food, plants and household goods arranged in a tidy,   manner that suggests either an artist’s eye or a latent psychological disorder.  The   photographer is a master of what has come to be known as ”organization porn,” stylized images of everyday objects stacked, laid and arranged in a neat, visually pleasing way.  These images have risen to viral prominence on sharing platforms like Reddit, Pinterest and Tumblr, as well as social media networks like Instagram.  Since Blincoe started her   Arrangements series in 2011, she has built her name    and an Instagram following of over 330, 000    off this aesthetic. Though it started as a personal project, she’s since created similar images for Gap, Target, and eBay. ”You could take a photo of a bouquet of flowers or you could spend five hours clipping the tops and arranging them by gradient,” she says. ”It’s just a different way of looking at something that other people aren’t willing to put in the time for.” But why are these images so popular among the neat and messy alike? Psychologists may have the answer.  Balancing order and chaos  According to Johan Wagemans, an experimental psychologist specializing in visual perception at Belgium’s University of Leuven, these images are fundamentally different from the stimuli the brain ordinarily gets.  Though the individual components depicted are familiar, the new context requires that the viewer look for more than just literal meaning in the image, much like abstract art.  ”It’s the fascination of the image being something different than a messenger of meaning,” he explains. ”Whenever we see things in our environment or when we look at images, the brain is organizing the inputs or trying to make sense of them. Usually, perception is after meaning, but when you start playing with images in a way like this, it’s clear that it’s not about meaning, it’s about the special relationship between things and how they form a group or a composition.” A typical, naturally occurring composition    say, leaves on a tree    does not merit a second look because it is both conventional and chaotic. A heap of leaves is uninteresting for the same reason. ”Suddenly there’s a structure or a composition on a higher level by arranging objects in a specific way,” he says. ”The combination between things that are very familiar and boring in themselves but are suddenly subject to a new organization creates something that wasn’t there in the beginning.” Indeed, this is what initially attracted   designer Austin Radcliffe to this style of image. As curator of Things Organized Neatly, a popular blog and   source for these   images, he’s seen thousands. ”What I like about it is visual interest, and the ways in which the objects relate to each other when you put them together. They can tell a story or draw comparisons or, at the very least, make things look nice together,” he says.   Radcliffe first started curating images in 2010, inspired by the gridded layouts designers used to organize their work, and the concept of ”knolling” popularized by artist Tom Sachs. (Radcliffe would go on to intern for Sachs in 2012.)  Since then, he’s amassed more than 350, 000 blog followers, spoken at the Tate Modern and Tate Britain art museums in London, and signed a deal for a book with Universe Publishing, an imprint of Rizzoli, due for release in 2016. Calmness and clarity  But for many of Radcliffe’s followers, the appreciation goes beyond the aesthetic.  ”I hear that a lot people go to my website to calm down, or to take a break, or relax or procrastinate,” he says.  ”I think there’s a calmness and sort of clarity to see everything that’s been neatly laid out, and clutter’s been erased. It’s just a very peaceful, serene way of organizing objects.”  Kathleen Vohs, a marketing professor at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, isn’t surprised by this reaction.  ”Clutter is very stressful on people’s psychology, and there have been a number of studies that have looked at what clutter does to people’s minds, and from that we can take the perspective that things that are tightly organized are going to have the opposite effect,” says Vohs.  Her own research, published in the   journal Psychological Science, supports that claim. After having participants work in either a tidy or cluttered environment, researchers observed that tidy environments encouraged participants to ”follow norms and stick to the rules.”  ”People find   to be comforting because they know exactly what to do, and not a lot of decisions have to be made,” she says.  ”If people are perhaps stressed out or somewhat exhausted from their normal everyday lives, looking at a   environment, a   environment could give that sense of calm or release because it sort of suggests that all you have to do is follow the rules, and everything will be okay.” Photographer Blincoe agrees, suggesting that the images are as calming to create as they are to consume. ”I’m not so particular in my personal life, you know. My house isn’t arranged by color, everything isn’t in place at all times. But I think it’s a good little kind of retreat for me to present these items in a visually appealing way,” she says.  ”It’s not something that I set up like, ’Oh, thank god I got that out of me,’ but you know, it’s definitely a part of what I love to do.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42687,61633,Opinion: ’It’s a girl!’ Not so fast ...,CNN,<strong>Avery Wallace</strong>,3/17/2015,2015,3,," (CNN) From the moment we are born, the first question our parents are asked is, ”Is it a boy or a girl?”  The answer to that seemingly simple question quickly establishes the child’s path and trajectory for years to come however, the question is not simple. The question is tragically flawed and here’s a newsflash for everyone who has ever asked new parents that question: You’re asking the wrong people.  I realize that parents are simply sharing a bit of biological information based on their baby’s physical ”parts,” but only that beautiful baby can accurately and authentically tell you what gender he or she is. You may want to give it a little time before you paint that nursery bright pink or pick out junior’s first baseball glove    it’s just not that simple. I may only be 15 years old and will be the first to admit that I know very little about this great big world, but I know way too much about gender and being mislabeled.  Why transgender teen Jazz Jennings is everywhere, You see, the doctor told my parents, ”It’s a girl,” but he couldn’t have been more wrong. Aside from my biology, I knew I was a boy from the age of 2. I was 100% sure of who I was and biology was an insignificant part of the conversation.  Keep in mind that this was a time before I had even realized that being a boy trapped in a girl’s body was anything beyond normal, and this was long before I could possibly articulate what was happening.  However, there was no need to articulate anything. I was a little boy expressing myself based on what was in my heart and mind    not yet distorted by biology, other people’s confusion, or fear.  It was when I was older that other people let me know something was ”off.” No matter how many times I was told differently, I was a boy and the people that mattered knew it too, for the most part.  I want to address the moment where people, gender, and respectful communication part ways. That is the moment when the word ”sexuality” creeps into the conversation. That is when people get scared, cite religion, start whispering, and disconnect.  It’s a sad moment, but I get it.  People have always mocked what they don’t understand, and this is a tough one for most to grasp. That said, it has to change and I believe it is changing.  The transgender life: What to know, say and understand, I cannot stress to the world enough, gender and sexuality are two completely different things, and the moment people incorrectly connect them is the moment when most people start looking for an exit or a fight.  Save your fear people. This is not something to be afraid of it’s an opportunity for us to evolve.  Nothing is completely black or white, hot or cold, here or there, or male and female there are varying degrees of everything and the quicker we respect that, the faster we all grow and allow people to be who they are. It all starts by taking sexuality out of the initial conversation.  I first heard the term ”gay” in the second grade, long after I had my first ”girlfriend” and had proudly written ”a penis” at the top of my Christmas list.  Not until after I learned that there was such a thing as sexuality and homosexuality did I become afraid of who I was.  It wasn’t until I learned that there were people out there that considered homosexuality ”abnormal” or that people needed to put labels on our feelings toward others that I became terrified that I was ”different.”  I knew I liked girls and I was technically a girl, biologically, but I was a boy and my feelings about girls were normal boy feelings. I was not gay    but try to explain that to someone without his or her eyes glazing over.  Thankfully, I grew up in a household that taught me that I could love anybody I wanted to and it was fine because it is fine. Anyone can love anyone and there is nothing wrong with that. Fortunately, people have developed more of an understanding of that over time, but there are always going to be people that think differently and we all have to accept that. Do they matter? Of course they do because we all matter, equally however, ignorant people are here to help us learn how to better communicate everyone is reachable with the right circumstances and I look forward to the battles as much as the victories.  As long as you’re happy, you’re indestructible. That said, I knew being gay wasn’t a bad thing, but I also knew it didn’t describe me. I was a straight boy who liked girls and there is nothing wrong with that, either.  I was afraid of being thought of differently. The most crippling fear came from people not understanding that I was a boy trapped in a girl’s body and simply labeling me something I’m not. That’s what I was truly afraid of.  Discovering that I was transgender was a miraculous moment. I finally found the key that unlocked the cage I’d been trapped in for 14 years and that’s why I call this journey, ”My Transcension.” With the support of my parents, I am sharing my story. Breaking free and owning your sexuality is something you find within yourself and is spectacular, but it is just the tiniest part of the greater transgender conversation. I am going beyond that and my journey is one that is constantly moving forward and upward.  I’m taking the body I was born into and transforming it into the body I know I’m supposed to be in    thanks to my family, friends, Dr. Jo Olson, the support groups, the science, and lastly, myself.  See, that’s the irony, I was the first person and truly the only person capable of answering the ”is it a boy or girl” question    not the doctor, my parents, or anyone who thinks they know better.  That is the lesson, let each of us dictate our own path and respect everyone’s choice. I realize that it’s easier said than done but if you read this and find yourself open to a new conversation about gender, I consider that a win for us all.  Truthfully, I’m most proud of myself for having the courage to find my own way and owning it, to proudly begin my transcencion from someone I wasn’t    into the man I always knew I’d become.  Whether I’m a boy or a girl, white or black, rich or poor, gay or straight, it’s completely irrelevant. What truly matters is the fact that I’m Avery Wallace and I’ve always known exactly who I was. I’m here to share my journey and hopefully, help someone else recognize theirs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43952,62904,Government says four cancer charities are shams,CNN,<strong>Drew Griffin<strong></strong></strong>,5/19/2015,2015,5,,"Washington (CNN) In a rare joint action with attorneys general for each of the 50 states, the Federal Trade Commission says four cancer charities run by extended members of the same family conned donors out of $187 million from 2008 through 2012 and spent almost nothing to help actual cancer patients. Each of the charities charged were the subject of extensive reporting by CNN in 2013.  And in each instance, none of the four charities would comment. We were ordered out of the building at the Cancer Fund of America in Knoxville, Tennessee, and were the object of an obscene gesture by the CEO of The Breast Cancer Society in Mesa, Arizona. The Cancer Fund of America is run by James Reynolds Sr. His son James Reynolds Jr. is the CEO of the Breast Cancer Society. Another charity, the Children’s Cancer Fund of America, is run by Rose Perkins, the   of the elder James Reynolds. He’s also the CEO of the fourth charity, Cancer Support Services. The government says the charities claimed to provide direct support for cancer patients, breast cancer patients and children with cancer. ”These were lies,” the government’s complaint says. Jessica Rich, chief of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, says that in all, the charities spent about 97% of donations they received either on private fundraisers or on themselves. Only 3% she says, went to help actual cancer patients. According to the complaint, funds donated to help cancer patients instead went for personal use, in often lavish ways. ”[D]onated funds were used to pay for vehicles, personal consumer goods, college tuition, gym memberships, Jet Ski outings, dating website subscriptions, luxury cruises, and tickets to concerts and professional sporting events,” the complaint says. ”Most of what we are doing is bringing actions against fraud,” says Rich. ”And this is as about as bad as it can get: taking money away from cancer victims.” CNN Investigations: Hidden cameras reveal airport workers stealing, There was also what the FTC calls ”rampant nepotism” at play in all of the charities. For instance, at the Breast Cancer Society, James Reynolds Jr. hired his wife, Kristina Hixson, to be his public relations manager. The complaint states that he also hired Hixson’s two sisters, her son by a previous marriage, her mother and her  . According to the complaint, Hixson’s mother had been a caterer. At the Breast Cancer Society, she was hired to write grant applications.  Moreover, on their tax returns, each charity claimed millions of dollars in donated goods shipped to overseas locations on behalf of cancer patients. The complaint says the charities never owned any of the goods in question and simply paid a fee to a private firm in South Carolina to ship the goods, called   . CNN went to Guatemala in early 2014 to investigate anyone who may have received those gifts and could find no evidence that they even existed. As a result of the complaint, two of the charities say they will close their doors. Both the Breast Cancer Society and the Children’s Cancer Fund of America are being dissolved, according to the complaint. James Reynolds Jr. faces a judgment of more than $60 million in fines and Rose Perkins, who runs the Children’s Cancer Fund of America, faces a judgment of around $30 million.   Under a proposed final order, the judgment against Reynolds Jr. will be suspended when he pays $75, 000. The judgments against Children’s Cancer Fund of America will be partly met upon liquidation of its assets, and the judgment against Perkins will be suspended due to her inability to pay.  CNN Investigations: Many airport workers not screened, The FTC’s Jessica Rich, however, said there are few assets left. Government regulators will be lucky to recover $1 million, she told CNN. As for James Reynolds Sr. he will contest the charges in the complaint, the government says. CNN hasn’t yet been able to reach attorneys for Reynolds Sr. his son or Perkins for comment, but in a message posted on the Breast Cancer Society website, Reynolds Jr. said: ”While the organization, its officers and directors have not been found guilty of any allegations of wrong doing, and the government has not proven otherwise, our Board of Directors has decided that it does not help those who we seek to serve, and those who remain in need, for us to engage in a highly publicized, expensive, and distracting legal battle around our fundraising practices.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

45321,64293,700-year-old doodles by medieval scribes,CNN,<strong>Jake Wallis Simons</strong>,11/3/2014,2014,11,," (CNN) My personal favorite is this. At the top of a page of angular medieval text    full of theological extrapolations and religious devotion    is a cartoon of a deadpan dog. ”It’s amazing to think that people doodled in medieval times in a similar way to how they doodle today,” said Erik Kwakkel, a book historian at Leiden University, Holland.  ”When you see the monks expressing their personalities, their sense of humor, it makes you feel like you’re traveling back through time. It’s like you’re going through the keyhole and sitting right next to them.” Indeed, that dog would not be out of place in ”The Simpsons.” The spacesuit inspired by medieval armor, ’Medieval eye candy’ Kwakkel is making an unlikely name for himself on the internet by posting ”medieval eye candy” that he comes across during the course of his research. And the doodles are by far the most popular. ”Normally, scribes would doodle or write snatches of lettering after cutting their nibs, to make sure they were the correct width,” he said. ”These   ranged from the sort of scribbled lines that people still do today to words, names, full sentences or simple drawings. Sometimes we even find pretty good drawings.” These include funny faces with long beards, big hats or noses, as well as animals, unidentifiable creatures and even caricatures of teachers and colleagues.  In the majority of cases, the doodles were never intended to be seen. They were drawn on the outside of the first and last pages of a book, which were later glued to wooden covers. But although the glue has obliterated a great many doodles and   a variety has survived the test of time. ”They offer a rare glimpse into the informal or private world of medieval monks,” Kwakkel said.  ”Personally, I love the thumbprint, which was left by a careless scribe who spilled ink on his work. It seems so fresh and human, yet it happened 700 years ago.” World’s coolest bookstores, Hidden meanings, For modern scholars, doodles and   can be more than mere curiosities.  When the scribes were trying out their quills, they often wrote in their own handwriting, rather than the heavily prescriptive styles demanded by their work. This allows academics like Kwakkel to identify individual scribes    who were rarely credited for their work    and track their careers, including when they migrated across Europe. Sometimes, they can also tell us about the classroom environment. ”I found one that is obviously a drawing of the face of a schoolmaster. You can recognize him from the teacher’s hat on his head,” Kwakkel said. ”It was obviously drawn by a student in class, seven centuries ago.” Some may have had a deeper meaning at the time too, particularly the ones in the margins of the text (known technically as ”marginalia”).  One common trope was a drawing of a person’s profile with a long, pointed nose. Kwakkel believes that this was intended to highlight a particularly important sentence, as indicated by the end of the nose. Another example shows a snatch of musical notes together with the lyrics of a hymn. The monk was probably trying to remind himself of a song this, Kwakkel says, is ”one of the earliest example of musical notation that we have.” Ancient book bound with human skin, Treasure troves of secret manuscripts, But the aspect of his work that most excites Kwakkel is the uncovering of fragments of ancient texts, which he describes as ”treasure troves” or ”stowaways.” ”After Gutenburg invented the printing press in 1436, the old handwritten manuscripts fell out of fashion. Some were thrown away, but others were chopped up and used in bindings and covers,” he explained. ”I often take 15 students to a library for three days, and we carefully open up the bindings of medieval books to reveal what is inside. ”We have found many fascinating, rare manuscripts this way. It is magical, like uncovering a time capsule.  ”I know there is a lot of stuff hidden out there in bindings waiting to be discovered, but I can’t fathom what it might be.” His discoveries include the rough workings of medieval scholars who were translating texts from Arabic to Latin. Ordinarily, only the finished copies survive, so these manuscripts open up a new area of research into the translators’ methodology. But his favorite is a stash of 132 notes, letters and receipts that came from the house of a German nobleman. One, dated 31 May 1486, was a note to a servant. ”Could you please get me some wild roses, but make sure to include some that are still in bud,” it says. ”That was breathtaking,” said Kwakkel. ”It was so casual and romantic. It as if it had been written just yesterday.” The future Underground: London’s new   tube trains, Did artists eerily predict the Ukraine crisis? Would you eat Fukushima soup?

45352,64325,What we can learn from the tattoos of our ancestors,CNN,<strong>Jake Wallis Simons</strong>,9/22/2014,2014,9,," (CNN) Eight thousand years ago, a pencil mustache was tattooed onto the upper lip of a young Peruvian man. His mummified body has since become the oldest existing example of tattoo art on the planet. Today’s world is, of course, almost unrecognizable by comparison. But according to Professor Nicholas Thomas, Director of the Museum of Archeology and Anthropology at Cambridge University    author of a new book about body art    the tattoo has made a powerful comeback. ”There has been an extraordinary, epochal change in the last 25 years,” he says. ”When I was a child in the 1960s, we didn’t see tattoos everywhere. But there has been an explosion in popularity, and this tells us a lot about who we are, both culturally and as individuals.” In fact, according to some studies, up to 38% of Americans and a fifth of British adults have some type of   body art.  Many interlocking factors have a bearing on the popularity of the tattoo. Foremost among them is a change in the popular conception of the body. ”Because of advances in technology and medical science, people no longer understand the body as something natural that you’re born with and live with. Instead, we understand it much more as something that is changeable and mutable,” says Professor Thomas. ”People have all sorts of surgical interventions, medical and cosmetic. It is even possible to change your gender. This means that we now see our body as something we have a responsibility to design and make. Even something as simple as a fitness routine or a tan indicates this attitude.” Read: Society isn’t quite ready for facial tattoos, A permanent stamp of identity, In addition, as global mobility leads to the increasing pluralization of society, identity is also being seen as something to be designed rather than inherited. ”People are no longer simply British or Australian or Californian,” he says. ”Our identities are far more particular, linked to our interests, affinities to cultural or spiritual traditions, tastes in music, and subcultural allegiances. The tattoo has become a vehicle for that sort of particular identification.” The recent surge in popularity for tattooing started in the California   scene of the Sixties and Seventies. During the 20th Century, tattoos had become associated with criminals, sailors and members of the military, who had become dislocated from mainstream society and wanted to stamp a commemoration of that experience on their bodies. The Californians took that trend and subverted it, inventing their own designs and viewing body ink as an art form rather than a type of social branding. More recently, there’s been a return to traditional forms of tribal tattoos. Ancient Celtic designs, or those originating in the Pacific Islands, provide inspiration for a great number of body ink enthusiasts (although it remains unusual to see a young man with a tattoo of a pencil mustache). In the past, however, tattoos were not used to form individual identities. Instead they tended to be a collective cultural project, constituting particular social markers. Sometimes they created a spectacular appearance when a tribe all shared the same design in other instances, they were used as initiation or    rites. ”In Samoa, men have elaborate tattoos inked on their thighs, buttocks and lower chest,” says Professor Thomas. ”It is a painful ordeal that requires a man to submit to the authority of the elders. When he emerges, he is celebrated as a hero.” Read: Tattoos and piercings: How young is too young? Tattoos and individualism, The Samoans, and many other traditional communities, saw having a tattoo as an important process rather than a possession. The whole body was tattooed at once, and it was rarely supplemented. By contrast, the modern tattoo enthusiast tends to view them as an expanding collection that creates permanent markers of important moments in an individual’s life. ”Globalization is exposing us to a whole range of traditions from many places,” Professor Thomas says. ”Body art is becoming the opposite of conformity, a sort of badge of travel, or internationalism. People visit places and make them parts of themselves, so that they will forever bear marks of their unique visit.” As Jonny Depp once put it, ”My body is my journal and my tattoos are my story”. But does this indicate an underlying cultural anxiety? Are we literally growing less comfortable in our own skin? ”That’s part of it,” says Professor Thomas. ”As the world opens up culturally and economically, there are fewer certainties than there ever were before, and far more multiplicity. So people are trying to invent themselves, and make it permanent.” Often, he continues, people who feel that a spiritual dimension is missing in contemporary Western life may be attracted to the spiritual symbols of traditional cultures around the world, which are often ”understood naively in terms of spirituality”. Read: Suffering from ’tattoo regret’ The Christian approach towards tattoos, The decline of Christianity in the West has also had a degree of influence on the rise of the tattoo. Some streams of Christianity have condemned body art due to the perceived sanctity of the body. But this is far from universal. During the Renaissance, for example, European devotees who went on pilgrimage to the Holy Land often had tattoos of Christian symbols or scenes to commemorate the experience. Many were carried out by the Razzouk family in the Old City of Jerusalem (members of that family are still carrying out the service today). But whatever your type of tattoo, research has shown that it profoundly alters the way in which you will be perceived. Adults with tattoos have been shown to be more sexually active to engage in riskier behavior and to have stronger   and   though this sharply declined in women three weeks after the tattoo. Moreover, academic studies of first impressions of people with tattoos have revealed that they were expected to have had more sexual partners, be less inhibited, and to be probable  . Whether tattoos are the cause or the effect of such personality types is a moot point. But one thing is certain: given that the fragmentation and diversification of modern life shows no sign of reducing, body art is going to be here to stay.

41365,60248,U.S. slaps new sanctions on North Korea after Sony hack,CNN,<strong>Jim Acosta</strong>,1/2/2015,2015,1,,"Honolulu, Hawaii (CNN) The United States is hitting North Korea with a new set of economic sanctions after determining the country was behind last month’s computer hack at Sony.   The White House said a new executive order targets leaders in North Korea’s government, preventing them from accessing property and entering the United States. The isolated nuclear regime, which has denied involvement in the Sony hack, was already subject to a strict set of U. S. economic restrictions.   The Federal Bureau of Investigation has maintained North Korea was behind the broad computer breach at Sony, despite evidence that some technology experts said points instead to former employees of the studio. On Friday officials said the new set of sanctions was further indication of their confidence in North Korea’s culpability, and said that private tech firms aren’t privy to the intelligence proving Pyongyang’s guilt.       President Barack Obama signed the executive order putting the new sanctions in place on the    day of his winter vacation in Hawaii. Before his vacation began in   Obama said North Korea was responsible for the attack and the United States was preparing a response. The White House said Friday’s announcement reflected the beginning of that response. RELATED: Obama says North Korea’s hack not war, but ’cybervandalism’ ”The order is not targeted at the people of North Korea, but rather is aimed at the government of North Korea and its activities that threaten the United States and others,” Obama wrote in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner.     The country poses a ”continuing threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States,” Obama wrote.       Among the agencies targeted by the new sanctions Friday was the Reconnaissance General Bureau, an intelligence agency the United States said was responsible for ”major cyberoperations” in North Korea.       The new sanctions also target officials at North Korea’s Mining Development Trading Corporation, which the United States says is responsible for the country’s arms dealing and weapons export business.     Seven officials who represent North Korea’s arms dealing trade in Africa, Iran, Russia and Syria were designated by the U. S. Treasury as subject to the new economic sanctions. U. S. administration officials said the individuals targeted by Friday’s sanctions are not thought to be responsible for the Sony hack. But in exposing their names and positions as North Korean arms dealers, the United States hopes to stymie their business prospects. Their names were not publicly known until now. U. S. officials said they didn’t know whether the 10 North Korean officials listed by the Treasury Department held any assets in U. S. institutions. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the sanctions were meant to ”isolate key North Korean entities and disrupt the activities of close to a dozen critical North Korean operatives.” ”We will continue to use this broad and powerful tool to expose the activities of North Korean government officials and entities,” Lew said. RELATED: North Korea lambasts U. S. over ’The Interview,’ says Obama is the ’culprit’ Speaking to CNN late last month, Obama said the United States would respond to the Sony hacking ”proportionately,” without specifying what actions his government might take to punish Kim Jong Un’s government for its role in the attack.      Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said on Friday, ”Today’s actions are the first aspect of our response.” That seemed to indicate the widespread Internet outages reported in North Korea last week were not a retaliatory response to the Sony hack, though administration officials would not confirm the blackout came at the hands of the United States. ”There are many possible explanations for (North Korea’s) Internet outage, including the possibility that they had ended up doing it to themselves,” one U. S. official said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42851,61797,LDS church: No tolerance for sex abuse in Boy Scouts,CNN,<strong>Kyra Phillips<strong></strong></strong>,3/23/2015,2015,3,," (CNN) The Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints, which is the largest sponsor of Boy Scout troops in the United States, says the church has strong measures in place to prevent the sexual abuse of scouts, as claims have been made it hasn’t done enough. In the first interview about allegations of abuse in Mormon   scouting troops, Church Elder L. Whitney Clayton told CNN that the church is at the forefront for prevention of child abuse. ”We feel like there is really no other organization that we know of    a church or something like a church    that does as much as we do,” Clayton said. ”We have a zero tolerance policy or position with respect to child abuse, and we train our people, we teach our people, we work with leaders, we provide materials online and in hard copy.” Over several months, CNN examined allegations of abuse that were detailed in at least five lawsuits filed against the church and the scouts.  But Clayton said the church today is proactive, even constructing its buildings ”in such a way as to try to avoid any situation where child abuse could occur.” ”For instance, if you walk down the hallway in an LDS chapel, a Mormon church, and look at the Sunday school classes, you’re going to see windows in the doorways into those Sunday school classes so people can look inside and walk by,” he said. The interview with Clayton followed a CNN investigation into the case of Melvin Novak, who was sexually abused by his scoutmaster, a member of the Mormon Church, beginning when he was 14 years old in 1998, according to the lawsuit Novak filed against the church and the Boy Scouts of America. The scoutmaster, Vance Hein, had been forced in resign from scouting in the early 1990s after reports surfaced that he failed to report a fellow scoutmaster who was engaged in homosexual activities. That scoutmaster ended up going to prison for sexual assaults on minors. Hein’s name was added to the Boy Scouts of America’s ineligible volunteer files, which are widely known as the ”perversion files.” The documents, which were made public in 2012, are lists of scout leaders suspected of sexual abuse or homosexual activity. However, three years after being kicked out of scouting, Hein was allowed to rejoin the scouts after getting letters of recommendation attesting to his character. One of those letters was from Hein’s influential Mormon Bishop Jack Moyer, who wrote that Hein was ”highly respected and liked.” Moyer, who is now retired, declined to speak to CNN. But in a deposition taken as part of the lawsuit last year, he acknowledged that he would not have written the letter knowing what he later found out about Hein. The lawsuit charged that Hein ”actively groomed young boys under his charge for later sexual molestation.” Hein eventually was convicted of molesting Novak. He is now in prison for violating probation in the Novak case. Ken Rothweiler, who is Novak’s lawyer, said what happened in the case is outrageous. ”This case is probably the most egregious of all of the cases against the LDS church, and the reason I say that is because the LDS church knew that Vance Hein, this pedophile, was already kicked out of scouting by the Boy Scouts of America,” Rothweiler said. However, church attorney David Pittinsky said it was the Boy Scouts organization that should have done something. ”If the Boy Scouts had disclosed to Bishop Moyer the information they had in their files, there is no way that Vance Hein would have ever become a scoutmaster, and he would have been subject to excommunication by the church,” Pittinsky said. In a statement to CNN, the Boy Scouts of America said Hein was removed from scouting ”for reasons unrelated to child abuse.” The group added, ”Our efforts to protect youth were plainly insufficient, inappropriate or wrong. We extend our deepest apologies to victims and their families.” Read the full response from the Boy Scouts, The case ended last year with a confidential settlement paid to Novak, who is now 31. All but one of the five lawsuits filed against the church and Boy Scouts of America have been settled. Hein was sentenced to probation in 2000 after pleading guilty to indecently assaulting Novak. While on probation, he was arrested for possession of child pornography and was sentenced in 2012 to 15 to 30 years in prison. ”Any case is alarming to me. It’s a tragedy,” Clayton said. ”I’m a father. I have seven children, four boys and three girls. I have 19 grandchildren. The thought of one of them as a child or youth being abused is absolutely horrific to me.”  Asked what he would say to Novak, Clayton said, ”I say to him and anyone else who has been abused in the church or other churches    I’m sorry that you’ve gone through what you’ve gone through. It’s a horrible thing for anyone to be abused. No child, no youth should ever have to go through that.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43460,62409,Everest climbers keep wary eye on deadly icefall,CNN,<strong>Madison Park</strong>,4/16/2015,2015,4,," (CNN) Mountaineers have returned to Mount Everest for this year’s climbing season, resuming the quest to summit the world’s highest peak after a deadly season last year.  In 2014, the Nepal climbing season ended after a piece of glacial ice fell, unleashing an avalanche that killed 16 Nepalis who had just finished their morning prayers. The April 18 accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on Mount Everest. The deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the Sherpas and the dangers of climbing Everest.  In order to reduce risks, the route through Khumbu Icefall, the notoriously treacherous path where the 16 were killed, has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer. ”They’re going in the icefall and, as we found out on April 18, it’s the most dangerous place,” said Conrad Anker, a veteran climber who has been to Everest three times. ”They’re exposed to the tumbling ice, hanging seracs above it. It’s very, very dangerous. It’s the most dangerous place I’ve been in the mountains.”  At this point in the season, climbing teams have not yet entered Khumbu Icefall, which is essentially a frozen river rapid with jagged pieces breaking off and moving.  Nepal has issued 347 permits this year to climb Mount Everest, with 125 of them from the previously shortened season, according to the Nepal Ministry of Tourism.  It’s a slight increase from the 334 who were given permission last year.  The new path  The local Nepalese committee that determines the path up Everest announced in February that a different route had been selected. The climbers will now take a central route through the Khumbu Icefall, avoiding the area where the deaths occurred. The committee comprised of Sherpas voted to return to the central route for safety reasons. ”There will be little risk of avalanche than in the right or left,” said Yangji Doma Sherpa, the spokeswoman for the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee. The central route had been used in the 1990s, but was abandoned in favor of a quicker route, she said. The new path means climbers will have to cross more crevasses, and use more vertical and horizontal ladders. The committee issued a recommendation that the weight of workers’ gear be limited to avoid overloading the ladders.  ”I think it will be an hour longer on the icefall,” said Alan Arnette, who is blogging from Everest base camp this season. ”I don’t think it will be game changer.” Skipping the icefall  But one company, Alpenglow Expeditions, said it would stop climbing from the Nepal side, where the climbers have to go through the icefall, in favor of the northern route from China.  ”We’ve seen it get progressively more dangerous over the last few years,” said  Adrian Ballinger, the company’s founder and CEO. ”We believe the risk is too great for our workers.”  According to the China Tibet Mountaineering Association, 320 people have been registered to climb the northern route to Everest this year. That’s 136 more than last year.   The Chinese side of Everest has typically been less popular than its Nepal counterpart, because of concerns of government closures. Some Everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain, but it also doesn’t have an icefall. The increasing popularity of the northern route has caused concern amongst Nepali companies that climbers will divert to the Chinese side.  ”I can already see the shift with mountaineers I speak to,” said Dawa Steven Sherpa, who is based in Nepal. ”More people are going to go to Tibet than Nepal. Nepal needs the tourism far more than China does. China has incredible wealth of resources and Nepal does not.” Why they return to the mountains, Leading expeditions is how Sherpas feed their families and send their children to school. Nepal depends heavily on tourism dollars. Many of the guides had to bury their friends after the accident last year, and while they may be ready to return to the summit, their families are not. Many of them are ”leaving behind nervous,   wives and children,” whose memories of what happened last year are fresh, said Dawa Sherpa, managing director of Asian Trekking.  ”They do say they don’t want to put them through that again,” he said. ”They’re not fearful for their own lives, it’s what they’re putting their family through.”  Several mountaineers are also returning this year.  One of them is Jon Reiter, who spoke to CNN last year after the tragedy. When the icy avalanche thundered down, Reiter was shoved behind an ice block by his Sherpa guide.  Reiter, who is making his way to base camp this year, could not be reached directly. But he explained why he’s heading back to Everest this year on his blog.  ”I can’t quite find the words to tell you why, or what really pulls me back to the mountains,” he wrote.  ”When we were in the midst of last year’s events it was hard to see the big picture. It was hard to remember that people die in the mountains but that it’s more rare than not. ”It was hard for me to remember that I’m not choosing between my life at home and dying in the mountains. I like to think it’s similar to surviving a plane crash or a major pile up on the freeway.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44366,63329,"South Korea MERS outbreak grows as 1,369 in quarantine",CNN,<strong>Madison Park</strong>,6/3/2015,2015,6,,"Hong Kong (CNN) The World Health Organization warned that the MERS outbreak in South Korea is likely to grow, as the number of people under quarantine crept up to 1, 369 on Wednesday.  The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed five new cases    increasing the number of people with the disease to 35. These new cases were contracted within hospitals.  So far, three people have died after contracting the respiratory virus in South Korea, the country’s Health Ministry said Thursday, in the largest MERS outbreak outside Saudi Arabia.  The first case, concerning a man who returned to South Korea after traveling to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE and Bahrain, was reported on May 20. The person had not been ill during his travels, according to the World Health Organization.  More than 900 schools have shut to prevent the spread of the virus, according to South Korea’s education ministry.  The extent of the outbreak in South Korea has taken many by surprise    mainly because the virus has not been shown to spread easily between humans and the health care system in the country is considered to be sophisticated and modern.   South Korean President Park   acknowledged problems in the country’s early response earlier this week.  ”Initial reaction for new infectious diseases like MERS is very important, but there were some insufficiency in the initial response, including the judgment on its contagiousness,” she said.  She convened an emergency MERS meeting on Wednesday. MERS is in the same family of viruses as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) as well as the common cold. However, MERS does not spread easily between humans    as far as scientists know at this point. ”So far, the virus has been circulating in humans for three years,” said Dr. Leo Poon, a virology expert at the School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong, who worked on the SARS outbreak more than a decade ago. ”We found little transmission in human. We know there is    transmission, but it’s not sustainable.” Then why is it spreading in South Korea?  Since MERS, short for Middle East respiratory syndrome, was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, international cases have largely been confined to travelers bringing the virus back to other countries and infecting one or two others. There have been deaths in countries like Oman, Algeria, and Malaysia    but none of them had additional infections to the extent of South Korea.  ”This is quite unusual. I think this is the only country, apart from those in the Middle East, that has such a number of cases,” said Poon. ”It’s not entirely surprising. In the Middle East, people in Saudi Arabia had hospital outbreaks where a few people got infected. It’s a similar situation at the moment.” In early 2013, 23 MERS cases in eastern Saudi Arabia were linked to a single outbreak extending through four health care facilities.  Similarly, the vast majority of the South Korean cases have been linked to infections from hospitals.  Another factor for the spread in South Korea could be the fact that family members often stay with patients in their hospital rooms to watch and care for their loved ones.  ”With the hospital culture here, the family does a lot of the nursing. For general patients on the ward there are fewer nurses than we are accustomed to in the West,” said Dr. John Linton of Yonsei University’s Severance Hospital in Seoul. ”They would have been in close proximity to other patients.” How did it start in South Korea?  The first patient, a    man, had traveled to four Middle Eastern countries before returning to South Korea on May 4. During his flight, he did not have any symptoms.  As he started getting sick a week later, the Korean sought treatment at two clinics and two hospitals    ”creating multiple opportunities for exposure among health care workers and other patients,” according to the WHO. MERS was not suspected and health care workers did not treat the first patient in isolation.  As a result, the MERS cases in South Korea span patients from several health care facilities. Health officials have not identified the hospitals, but 22 of the current cases are related to those who were at what’s being called ”Facility B.” That hospital has closed voluntarily.  ”Given the number of clinics and hospitals that cared for the index case, further cases can be expected,” the WHO stated in a situation report on Wednesday. Some of the infected people occupied the same room as the first patient and others had been in the same ward for times ranging from five minutes to several hours, according to the WHO.  How does MERS spread?  Concern about the virus is gripping many in South Korea, with schools shutting and the increased use of face masks and hand sanitizers.  The virus acts like a cold and attacks the respiratory system, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. But symptoms, which include fever and a cough, are severe and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. MERS spreads from close contact with an ill person, such as living or caring for them.  5 things to know about MERS, About three to four out of every 10 people reported with MERS have died. But the people who died often had underlying medical conditions that made them more vulnerable.  The two patients who died in South Korea had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heavy asthma.  As of Wednesday, there have been 1, 179 confirmed cases of MERS reported to WHO since 2012, and at least 442 cases were fatal. Cases have been reported in 25 countries, with China and South Korea joining the ranks only last month, WHO said.  MERS has been linked to camels and it’s possible that some people became infected after coming into contact with camels, but it’s not completely clear.  There are no vaccines and no cures.  To prevent MERS, the CDC recommends everyday hygiene practices like   covering coughs and sneezes, and avoiding personal contact with sick people.

43056,62004,Research: Anne Frank perished earlier than thought,CNN,<strong>Madison Park<strong></strong></strong>,4/1/2015,2015,4,," (CNN) Seventy years ago, Anne Frank died of typhus in a Nazi concentration camp at the age of 15. Just two weeks after her supposed death on March 31, 1945, the   concentration camp where she had been imprisoned was liberated    timing that showed how close the Jewish diarist had been to surviving the Holocaust.  But new research released by the Anne Frank House shows that Anne and her older sister, Margot Frank, died at least a month earlier than previously thought.  Researchers   archives of the Red Cross, the International Training Service and the   Memorial, along with testimonies of survivors. They concluded that Anne and Margot probably did not survive to March 1945    contradicting the date of death which had previously been determined by Dutch authorities.  Their journey after the annex, In 1944, Anne and seven others hiding in the Amsterdam secret annex were arrested and sent to the    concentration camp. Anne Frank’s final entry, That same year, Anne and Margot were separated from their mother and sent away to work as slave labor at the   camp in Germany.  Days at the camp were filled with terror and dread, witnesses said. The sisters stayed in a section of the overcrowded camp with no lighting, little water and no latrine. They slept on   straw and violent storms shredded the tents, according to the researchers. Like the other prisoners, the sisters endured long hours at roll call.  Her classmate, Nannette Blitz, recalled seeing Anne there in December 1944: ”She was no more than a skeleton by then. She was wrapped in a blanket she couldn’t bear to wear her clothes anymore because they were crawling with lice.” Listen to Anne Frank’s friends describe her concentration camp experience, Their final days, As the Russians advanced further, the   concentration camp became even more crowded, bringing more disease. A deadly typhus outbreak caused thousands to die each day.  Typhus is an infectious disease caused by lice that breaks out in places with poor hygiene. The disease causes high fever, chills and skin eruptions.  ”Because of the lice infesting the bedstraw and her clothes, Anne was exposed to the main carrier of epidemic typhus for an extended period,” museum researchers wrote.  They concluded that it’s unlikely the sisters survived until March, because witnesses at the camp said the sisters both had symptoms before February 7.  ”Most deaths caused by typhus occur around twelve days after the first symptoms appear,” wrote  authors Erika Prins and Gertjan Broek. The exact dates of death for Anne and Margot remain unclear. Margot died before Anne.  ”Anne never gave up hope,” said Blitz, her friend. ”She was absolutely convinced she would survive.” Her diary endures as one of the world’s most popular books.

42562,61507,Prince Charles opens up about love and life,CNN,"<strong>Max Foster,</strong>",3/12/2015,2015,3,,"Aberdeenshire, Scotland (CNN) In an exclusive interview ahead of his U. S. tour    and ahead of his   wedding anniversary    Prince Charles paid tribute to the ”brilliant” way his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, has taken on the ”real, real challenge” of defining her public role. Watch ”Spotlight: Charles and Camilla” Saturday at 7:30 p. m. ET  to get an inside look at the royal couple as they prepare for their joint visit to the U. S. ”It’s always marvelous to have somebody who, you know, you feel understands and wants to encourage. Although she certainly pokes fun if I get too serious about things. And all that helps,” Prince Charles told CNN. The couple first visited the U. S. together as newlyweds in 2005, and Camilla was confronted by hardcore Princess Diana fans with abusive placards. Polls at the time found that between 57% and 73% of Brits opposed Charles’ new wife being known as queen. If you go back even further, to 1997, the year Diana died, an Ipsos MORI poll put it at 86%.  Reporter’s notebook: Interviewing the royal couple, But there’s been a change in sentiment since they married. A new poll conducted by Comres for CNN found that only 35% now oppose Camilla being known as queen. Nearly one in four said they liked her more now than they did 10 years ago.  This coincides with a change in palace strategy    away from the aggressive spin machine of the 1990s to simply allowing Camilla to be herself. When she appears in public, she’s either seen supporting her husband or promoting a set of causes she has a genuine connection with. Prince Charles praised how his wife has handled herself.   ”She’s done an enormous amount for the whole issue around osteoporosis, which of course runs in her family,” he said, noting that Camilla’s mother and grandmother both suffered from the bone disease. He also points to other issues Camilla is associated with, including literacy and preventing sexual violence.  The Duchess of Cornwall, by sticking to what she knows and cares about, is able to connect with the people she meets, which doesn’t always come across on camera. When Charles and Camilla married in 2005, there was huge sensitivity around the legacy of Diana, who was expected to be queen herself. With this in mind, royal aides announced that Camilla would not use the title of Queen when Charles becomes King. Instead she would be known as Princess Consort. That still stands, although the public of today looks less likely to oppose the title of Queen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41681,60615,Can tigers claw their way back from extinction?,CNN,"<strong>Monica Sarkar,</strong> ",1/20/2015,2015,1,," (CNN) Wild tigers in India appear to be staging a comeback in the battle against extinction, with the country’s Environment Minister announcing a 30% increase in the endangered species’ population since 2011. ”Our latest estimate today is that India has 70% of the world’s tiger population and we have now 2, 226 tigers presently in 47 tiger reserves [up from 1, 706 in 2011] and this is a great achievement. It is a net increase of 30% over the last estimation,”  Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said in a statement Monday. Researchers involved in the study, the third of its kind carried out in India, say they used advanced technology to assess the population of the big cats.  Debbie Banks, head of the Tiger Campaign at the Environmental Investigation Agency, which carries out extensive research on the illegal tiger trade, welcomed news of the study, saying she looked forward to seeing the full report when it releases in March. ”I think it has set India apart from some of the other tiger range countries. If you look at China, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, there’s more emphasis on tigers in captivity, farming and valuing tigers for their body parts higher than the survival of tigers in the wild,” she says to CNN. India’s   tiger population has been severely affected by poaching, a reduction in prey, habitat destruction and conflict with villagers who may occupy the same area.  Although preliminary results of the government’s study are promising, Banks warns against complacency. ”While this is good news from India, I don’t think anyone is sitting back and saying ’we’ve won.’ The demand within China for skins to decorate homes and bones for tiger bone wine all continue. And so it’s a constant battle.” A major challenge is also the sophistication of the tiger trade, where body parts of the animal are transported across unofficial borders, such as mountain passes. ”The criminals have changed their practice. And there’s no evidence of any enforcement there,” she says. A historical symbol of power and beauty in cultures such as India and China, the significance of the tiger goes beyond its aesthetics, Banks says.  ”Tigers are major indicator of the health of the environment, certainly the health of the forest that they inhabit. But they are the water gods, if you like. They are indicators of how well we are doing to conserve forests that provide water for millions of people and mitigate climate change.  ”There’s an ecosystem reason to save wild tigers.”  And if today’s results are anything to go by, Banks says India appears to be leading that charge. ”India, despite all the problems it has with high human population in small areas, is totally setting the benchmark for wild tiger conservation.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

41989,60931,Super Bowl: New England Patriots beat Seattle Seahawks,CNN,<strong>Ollie Williams</strong>,2/2/2015,2015,2,," (CNN) Where Katy Perry needed a big cat, the New England Patriots were carried to a stunning comeback by the resilience of Tom Brady. Follow us at @CNNSport and like us on Facebook, The    sacked and twice intercepted, refused to give in as the Patriots    at one point down by 10    fought their way to a   victory over the Seattle Seahawks in Glendale, Arizona. They were helped by one of the less likely calls in football history, as Seattle threw a second consecutive Super Bowl title into the hands of Malcolm Butler. Patriots rookie Butler made a   interception when the Seahawks, with the ball on the   line and seconds to play, mysteriously chose to pass after an improbable, juggling   by Jermaine Kearse. That moment gave Brady and coach Bill Belichick a fourth Super Bowl victory, a feat matched by only two other quarterbacks: Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw. ”I just had a vision that I was going to make a big play and it came true,” said Butler, 24. MVP Brady said: ”This has been a long journey. I’ve been at it for 15 years. This one came down to the end and this time, we made the plays. ”Our defense, what can you say about them? Malcolm, what a play. For a rookie to make a play like that and win us the Super Bowl is unbelievable.”   jeers, Ahead of the game, Belichick had been booed inside Glendale’s University of Phoenix Stadium    the retractable roof, unusually, left open    as Idina Menzel, the voice of Frozen’s Elsa, sang the   national anthem. Belichick and Brady have denied any wrongdoing regarding the lengthy and unresolved ’deflategate’ saga, which concerns underinflated footballs in the AFC Championship game against Indianapolis. However, Brady was evasive on the subject in a   interview aired on Sunday, and the jeers as Belichick appeared on the big screen made the feelings of many clear. With that controversy sidelined for the night, the 49th Super Bowl’s momentum changed as rapidly as Perry’s halftime hits and outfits. The Patriots had largely outplayed Seattle before the interval, Brady wearing down the Seahawks defense drive by drive. Brady, in his sixth Super Bowl, found Brandon LaFell for the opening touchdown. In the process, the Patriots left Seattle’s famed ’Legion of Boom’ verging on bust. Seattle cornerback Jeremy Lane had already departed the field with an ugly arm injury    the price he paid for a successful interception    and, with   Kam Chancellor, Earl Thomas and Richard Sherman all carrying injuries, substitute Tharold Simon became the latest Seahawk on the wrong end of a collision as he failed to stop LaFell. Brave move, Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson, essentially anonymous to this point, struck back with the night’s first phenomenal pass to    rookie and former shoe salesman Chris Matthews. That allowed the NFL’s quiet man    Marshawn Lynch    to drive over the line and score. Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski mowed down KJ Wright to restore New England’s advantage, but that only served to cue up one of the gutsier plays in Super Bowl history. With seconds remaining in the half, the Seahawks abandoned the safe option of a field goal. Instead, Wilson wasted just 1. 79 seconds in delivering a bullet pass down the throat of a jubilant Matthews in the end zone. Cue Katy Perry, who brought an almost overwhelming array of lights, pyrotechnics and songs to a halftime show she dedicated to her younger self. Arriving on a giant, mechanical lion before graduating to a shimmy with sharks, Perry opened with Roar before cramming in   blasts of Dark Horse, I Kissed a Girl, Teenage Dream and    lastly    Firework, during which she ascended aboard a shooting star. Guest star Missy Elliott emerged to an energetic Get Ur Freak On, relegating the show’s other name, Lenny Kravitz, to the background. When play restarted, Seattle were at the fore.  Having barely seen the ball, that   score sent the Seahawks into the second half in possession and in control. The reigning champions immediately moved up by three, Matthews again wrapping up a   pass play to set up a Seahawks field goal. After Brady threw his second interception of the night, Seattle wide receiver Doug Baldwin expertly lost New England’s Darrelle Revis by running him into an official    leaving Baldwin all alone in the end zone, and the NFC champions ahead by 10. Legion of gloom, Brady had been nowhere near perfect but demonstrated his determination as he shrugged off a poor throw, missing Julian Edelman, to find Danny Amendola and get the Patriots rolling again. Watched by the likes of Paul McCartney, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, the intensity of New England’s offense ground down the depleted Legion as the final minutes ticked away. With two minutes remaining, Brady once again tried to find Edelman in the end zone. This time he was successful, and the Patriots had overcome a   deficit. Seattle, however, should have had the last laugh. Having been granted a   slice of good fortune as the falling Kearse used both knees and a hand to somehow hold on to a pass, the Seahawks made what some observers labelled one of the worst calls in football history. On the brink of    Super Bowl victories, Seattle elected to throw the ball, shunning Lynch and gifting Butler the interception. Following that staggering climax, the game’s dying moments descended into a mass brawl which led to the ejection of the Seahawks’ Bruce Irvin. By that point, the fight simply delayed an inevitable New England victory. ”I can’t even tell you, I can’t even feel it,” said Seahawks coach Pete Carroll of the decision to throw the ball. ”For it to come down to a play like that, I hate that we have to live with that.” New England’s Edelman said: ”We made more plays, we executed when we had to, we have a mentally tough team that works their tails off. ”We are the epitome of what Boston is all about.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41406,60334,The 7 coolest things at CES 2015,CNN,<strong>Phoebe Parke</strong>,1/9/2015,2015,1,," (CNN) Each year tech junkies from around the world gather in Las Vegas for International CES, the Consumer Electronics Show where innovators come to show off their latest prototypes, preview products and announce new releases.  Although the show is over 40 years old, this year’s event, held from January 6   9, saw some of the most futuristic products ever, from driverless vehicles to a revolutionary battery which, according to its makers, could let you fully charge a cell phone in minutes. Here is some of the coolest tech from the show.  1.   unveiled its driverless vehicle.   Although the F 015 Luxury in Motion is just a concept car at the moment, the vehicle shows just how different Mercedes thinks our driving experience will be in the future with an automated driving option and luxury ”mobile living space” interior.  ”Quality time in private space will be the true luxury goods in the future,” said Dieter Zetsche, head of   cars in his CES keynote speech.  2. People controlled objects with a wave of the hand.  The latest version of Ring, by Logbar, was unveiled at CES 2015. The cloud control device allows you to do things such as play music from your phone or close curtains using gestures programmed into a smart phone app.  The $269. 99 device was named as a 2015 CES Innovation Awards Honoree in November 2014.

Empire Robotic’s Versaball is filled with a ”sand like material.” When air is pumped into the ball it softens, molding around an object, and then when air is removed, the green ball  hardens and grips objects from bricks to ping pong balls.  4. People scooted around on intelligent skateboards.  The IO Hawk is a ”Intelligent mobility device” which can travel at 6. 2 mph. It is powered by batteries and moves in response to pressure from your feet.  The $1, 799. 99 device is 4. 3 inches high and created a real buzz among the CES crowd.  5. Toshiba’s unveiled its concept robot, ChihiraAico.  ChihiraAico is probably the most realistic robot you’ve ever seen, and according to Toshiba will be used in the healthcare industry.  The aim was to make a service robot which looked and behaved like a human, but some CES attendees did not find it comforting at all.  6. A smart belt adjusted itself based on how much people ate.  The Emiota Smart Belt keeps track of your overall health using your waist size and will also auto adjust after a big meal to keep you comfortable.  The belt, which has not yet hit the market, can also nudge you when you’ve been stationary for too long.  7. Phones were charged in minutes.  StoreDot, an Israeli   showed off its   charger, which it claims works up to 100 times faster than others and can be used for phones, tablets, laptops and wearable tech.

42349,61292,Subway cars become a home for sea life,CNN,<strong>Phoebe Parke</strong>,2/26/2015,2015,2,," (CNN) Usually, dumping metal into the ocean is a bad thing, but for once throwing disused items into the sea is working out for the greater good.  Over 2, 500 New York subway cars have been used to create an underwater reef for crustaceans and fish in the Atlantic.  Over a period of three years, photographer Stephen Mallon of the Front Room Gallery captured images of the carriages being put in place, and his photos now are being shown in a solo exhibition in New York.   ”I had read about the subway cars being dropped into the Atlantic, but I thought the project was over,” said Mallon. ”Then in 2007 I was scouting for another shoot and saw the barges being loaded up.” Once the subway cars had been decommissioned, they were cleaned and every part of them that could be removed    seats, straps and wheels    was recycled or sold. Then the carriages were stacked onto a barge, which transported them to the dropping point.  A hydraulic lift picked them up and dropped them one at a time into the ocean about once a month, destined to become a long line of houses for sea life along the coast from Delaware to South Carolina.  ”I had never seen anything like this,” Mallon said. ”And I’ve been in New York for over 20 years . .. there’s a sense of vertigo as they drop    you want to hold on as it falls.” The    has an ongoing project entitled American Reclamation that explores the recycling industry in America. Mallon captured his images from a small boat facing the barge in locations including Delaware, Virginia and South Carolina.  Some cars have also been dropped in Georgia, although not all site locations are disclosed to the public, as some are used for ecological studies.  The project, run by New York’s Metropolitan transit authority, ended in 2010. But the carriages have a new life beneath the sea. ”We’ve been monitoring the carbon steel subway cars and they are holding up well,” said Jeffrey Tinsman, artificial reef program manager at the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.  ”They are still three dimensional, and provide thousands and thousands of square feet of hard surface for invertebrates to live on, some of which, such as blue mussels, could not live on the sand bottom that is naturally there.”  ”When you compare the amount of food available on this reef to the natural amount, there is 400 times as much food per square foot as the sand bottom,” Tinsman continued.  ”Fish such as black sea bass are not fast swimmers, so need structure to provide both food and shelter they wouldn’t, for example, be able to outswim a shark, but they could duck into the shelter instead.”  Stephen Mallon’s works are featured in the solo exhibition Patterns of Interest at NYU’s Kimmel Galleries from February 6 to March 15.

44965,63936,Annecy Film Festival: Best animation around the world,CNN,<strong>Phoebe Parke</strong>,6/19/2015,2015,6,," (CNN) The world of animation isn’t all child’s play. Savage deaths, troubling dreams, and passionate relationships are just some of the topics covered in these beguiling films created by   hands.   We asked the artistic director of the prestigious Annecy International Animated Film Festival in France, Marcel Jean, to pick out the best nominated short films from the event, which runs from June 15 to 20.   Hailing from across the world, the surreal movies were made with everything from clay, to illustration, and   papers.  Here are five of our favorites.  Estonia: Aleteadvuse Maja by Priit Tender   This Estonian film, which bears the English title ”House of Unconsciousness” is a surreal imagining of the dreams of chimney sweepers.  Director Priit Tender used a study on dreams as the basis of his surreal 10  minute piece which explores the most frequent images chimney sweepers dream about    from women on fire to giant seals.   : Amelia  Duarte by Alice Guimaraes and Monica Santos   This   pixilation tells the story of two lovers who are struggling to cope after their relationships ends.  They divide the city into two and Duarte tries to remove memories of Amelia from his life by cutting her name out of his vast book collection. Meanwhile, Amelia boils down her memories of Duarte into cold chemical equations.  Spain: The Guardian by Alessandro Novelli  Alessandro Novelli used the parable ”Before the Law” from Franz Kafka’s book ”The Trial” as inspiration for this mindful piece. Here, a peasant stands in front of a gate guarded by a fearsome guardian  who denies him entrance.  When the film showed at the Arizona International Film Festivals, Novelli commented said of piece: ”Sometimes we don’t have the strength to take decisions and live our lives how we want.”    Brazil: Guida by Rosanna Urbes  Guida has been working as an archivist for 30 years when one day she sees a newspaper ad looking for models for a life drawing class.

42076,61018,UVA rape case: What we do and don’t know,CNN,<strong>Sara Ganim</strong>,2/7/2015,2015,2,," (CNN) The University of Virginia and its campus police department are investigating a new report of a sexual assault in a campus residence as the college community struggles with how to move forward and improve its sexual assault policies after coming under national scrutiny. It’s the first report of a sexual assault on campus since the controversial and widely questioned Rolling Stone article, published in October, that depicted the brutal gang rape of a woman named Jackie. It’s also the only reported sexual assault in the university police public reports since the start of this   school year, according to a CNN review of records on its website. There are few details about this newest case.  A statement sent to students on Thursday said police were notified by the Dean of Students ”about a sexual assault incident reported to have occurred on January 30, 2015, in a residence hall  .”  The notice said police were notified on February 5, six days after the incident. Before the uproar over the Rolling Stone story, UVA policy allowed student victims to decide whether or not police were contacted after a sexual assault. Since then, the university mandated a ” ” policy, which has yet to be defined it’s unclear if the alleged victim in the latest assault participated in reporting it to police. University officials would not comment on those questions. This all comes as the university is trying to move forward from the fallout of the Rolling Stone piece. The story of Jackie has been questioned and has prompted several investigations    a police investigation, an internal review at UVA, and a Columbia Journalism Review of Rolling Stone’s reporting process. A lot is still unknown. Here’s what we do and don’t know: 1. Is the Rolling Stone story about Jackie fake? What we know: Some of the details in the story are not true. Charlottesville police informed the university at the start of the spring semester that its investigation has found no evidence that the brutal gang rape happened at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, as the Rolling Stone story alleged. However, the police have not ruled out that Jackie was raped    possibly even gang raped, somewhere else, perhaps on a different day. The investigation is ongoing, and police aren’t releasing any other details of what they’ve found.  CNN talked to several of Jackie’s friends who were with her the night she says she was allegedly attacked, and according to them, she told a different version of what happened that night. In the article, Jackie said she was   by seven men while two men looked on. Her friends said Jackie told them she was forced to give oral sex to five men. Jackie’s Rolling Stone version said the perpetrator was a man she met at her job at the university pool. She told her friends it was someone she met in her chemistry class. She told her friends the assailant’s name, but no one by the name she gave attended the University of Virginia, nor could anyone by that name be located in a database search across the United States. What we don’t know: We don’t know how much of the rest of the Rolling Stone story, including Jackie’s account, was correct. Jackie has not talked to any member of the media since Rolling Stone issued an apology for its reporting, and the writer of the story has not spoken publicly since the apology, either. Columbia Journalism Review is now   all of the details at the request of Rolling Stone. 2: What about other reports of rape at UVA? What we know: Some of the details in the Rolling Stone story that deal with the broader issue of how sexual assault reports are handled at UVA have been confirmed. For example, the university has admitted that it never expelled a single student for committing sexual assault, even when the student admitted it.  The law firm O’Melveny  Myers LLP is now looking into how the university has historically handled sex assault claims. Even before the Rolling Stone story, UVA was the subject of a Title IX lawsuit filed by a woman who said she was drugged and raped by a fellow student, and that the university medical center lost some of the evidence, that a nurse didn’t tell the truth about the woman’s injuries, and that a school administrator shared confidential information. In May 2014, the Department of Education for Civil Rights announced that it was investigating 55 schools, including UVA, for possible violations related to how it handles sex abuse claims. 3: What else is being investigated? What we know: Part of the independent investigation by O’Melveny  Myers is looking at how UVA responded specifically to Jackie’s astonishing accusations against members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. According to Rolling Stone, Jackie first reported her allegations to the university in the spring of 2013, months after the alleged assault happened. The university did not call police because Jackie did not want the police involved, Rolling Stone reported. However, many people on campus were well aware of Jackie’s shocking allegations. Several people present at the annual ”Take Back the Night” awareness event listened as Jackie took to a podium and told her story to a crowd of hundreds in 2014. The police were not called until the account was published in Rolling Stone in November, causing national scrutiny and outrage. What we don’t know: It’s unclear if police were aware in detail of the allegations before the Rolling Stone story was published. The fraternity Phi Kappa Psi expressed concern to police after members began to field questions from Rolling Stone about the allegation of a gang rape. It’s unclear exactly why that did not turn into a full police investigation. UVA officials were also involved in that conversation, Phi Psi said. 4: What’s happening with the fraternities?  After being suspended for the rest of the fall semester, the fraternities were allowed to come back in the spring as long as they signed a new operating agreement which mandates sober fraternity brothers at parties, bans the serving of   drinks, requires the use of guards at staircases, and other safety measures. This created some tension.  Phi Psi was the first to sign the new agreement, but two other fraternities accused the university of ”bullying” them into signing it.  Then, days later, some sorority members were appalled to learn that their national chapters banned them from attending any fraternity bid night activities on Saturday, January 31, one of the biggest celebrations of the year in campus Greek life. From outside Charlottesville, the University of Virginia appears to be a campus in turmoil, struggling with how to move on from allegations that sexual assaults are rampant. But on campus many student leaders, like Student Council President Jalen Ross, agree that some of that discourse is good    it will help them come up with the best plans for moving forward. But Ross also told CNN he’s concerned with the level of involvement the national fraternity and sorority organizations have had, and cautions that they do not speak for students on campus.​ 5. What about the rest of the campus? It’s clear from talking to students at UVA that many of them still see some merit to the criticisms of how the university handles sexual assault allegations. Many also believe that something bad may have happened to Jackie, although they are skeptical of the details in the Rolling Stone story. Most students got back from winter break and returned to normal life at school. Behind the scenes, leaders are working on new ways to tackle binge drinking and general campus safety. The university just adopted an ambassador program which provides sober escorts over the age of 21 for any student who needs help getting home. The ”zero tolerance policy” pledged after the Rolling Stone story has yet to be defined, and some advocates are worried that it will have a chilling effect on reporting of sexual assault. Ross said he’s been working with state legislators who have proposed mandatory reporting, to make sure that any new proposals also don’t discourage women from coming forward.

42592,61537,IRS scam costing victims $15 million,CNN,<strong>Sara Ganim</strong>,3/13/2015,2015,3,," (CNN) They are very convincing when they call. They have a Washington phone number and can cite your financial history down to the cent. They say you’re under investigation, in danger of losing your home, or worse, your freedom    unless you pay thousands of dollars on the spot. But they’re not real.  And you’re not in trouble.  Not unless you take it seriously.  This is a scam. A big one. Federal authorities say it’s the largest IRS impersonation scam they’ve ever seen    swindling victims out of more than $15 million since it began in 2013. ”They have information that only the Internal Revenue Service would know about you,” said Timothy Camus, deputy inspector general for investigations with the Treasury Department. ”It’s a byproduct of today’s society. There’s so much information available on individuals.” Using identity theft technology, the thieves have successfully victimized more than 3, 000 people in the past two years, although the Treasury Department cautions that number is only documented cases and the true number might be higher. Camus said they’ve recorded more than 366, 000 reports of contact with the scammers, and it’s increasing at a rate of 10, 000 to 12, 000 a week. Authorities believe the thieves are operating out of India, using phishing technology to make it appear they’re IRS agents in Washington. The Federal Trade Commission, which goes after scammers like these from a civil standpoint, and the Treasury Department, which leads the criminal probe, both have open investigations. The largest loss reported was a staggering $500, 000, Camus said. Most have lost about $5, 000. One of those victims was former NFL player Frank Garcia, who is now a sports radio host in Charlotte, North Carolina. When he got the call, it sounded so authentic, he left the radio station in a panic, scramming to get the money they wanted. 12 scams to avoid, ”The only thing running through my head is, I’m going to jail. I’m gonna be on television, in handcuffs, for tax evasion,” he recalled. ”I had to follow specific steps not to be arrested. That the authorities had been contacted and in fact, they are on the way and will be there in 30 minutes.” Garcia says he spent five hours driving to various stores around Charlotte, depositing $500 each time into a PayPal account set up by the woman on the phone. He ended up losing about $4, 000.  He, and other victims, told CNN the swindlers never let their victims hang up the phone. ”I have never been arrested in my life and was very scared,” said Kin Ko, a New Jersey resident who lost about $5, 000 after he says the impersonator told him he was facing five years in prison, and the IRS was about to confiscate his assets: His car, his house and all the money in his bank account. The person had a badge number, read him an arrest warrant from a nearby police jurisdiction. The thieves are incredibly smart and convincing. They harness stolen identities and use programs such as Google Earth to identity locations where their victims can transfer money. ”It sounded as legitimate as could be,” said Al Cadenhead, a pastor in North Carolina who also fell victim. ”They knew where I was. He told me where to go    to the Rite Aid, up two streets turn left to the Rite Aid. The names of the streets, it was really just incredible.” Cadenhead told CNN he didn’t come to his senses until he’d signed over $16, 000. Identity theft tops list of consumer complaints, ”It was like I came out of a coma and realized this was not normal and this is not how you do business,” he said. ”I know other people who’ve heard the story say ’How did a guy with a Ph. D. fall victim?’ I was the perfect victim. I’ve never been audited, never paid a traffic ticket. I don’t know how to pay fines. How do I know they aren’t stern and serious about everything?” Camus said many people are afraid when they hear from the IRS, so they do whatever the caller says. In December, federal authorities found and arrested two U. S.  ”runners” who admitted to transferring almost a million dollars from   cards to foreign bank accounts.  In many cases, victims are warned and stopped from sending more money by bank tellers or clerks at money wiring locations. Ko said that it was a bank teller who told him this was a scam when the impersonator asked him to go through a second round of depositing money. For Frank Garcia, the light came on when the woman on the phone asked him for another $8, 000 after he thought his debt had been paid. He says he decided to hang up and await what the woman promised would be an arrest    which, of course, never came. How hackers are stealing your tax refund, ”I felt taken advantage of. I felt small. And I was naive,” he said. ”I wasn’t aware. I didn’t understand the system. And didn’t blame anybody but myself for not taking more time to understand those things.” Often, Camus says, immigrants are targeted and threatened with deportation. The elderly are also a popular target, although the scam has grown so large, people of all ages, income levels and status are getting these calls. Treasury Department officials say if you get one of these calls, the best and simplest way to handle it is to hang up.  Camus himself, a Treasury Department investigator, even got one. He told them, ”Your time is coming.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43006,61954,12 famous photographs recreated in tiny models,CNN,"<strong>Sheena McKenzie,</strong>",3/27/2015,2015,3,," (CNN) What is it about iconic photographs that captivates our imaginations long after the last tank has rolled into Tiananmen, Titanic set sail, or Apollo 11 astronauts left their footprints across the moon? Even if you weren’t alive at the time, these images are stamped in our minds with all the familiarity of a family photo album.  So when Swiss artists Jojakim Cortis and Adrian Sonderegger set about recreating the world’s most famous photos in miniature models, the pressure was on to ensure every tuft of cloud, clump of soil, and tilt of the head was true to its original. ”Everybody knows these pictures    they stand for a special moment in history,” said    Cortis, who when not creating intricate scenes out of cardboard and cotton wool, works as a   advertising and magazine photographer with    Sonderegger. ”You can divide iconic pictures into two different kinds    there are the ones we only know from books because they’re so old.. And then there are the more recent ones, like   where everybody remembers what they were doing at the time. When people look at these pictures, the feelings are more personal.” Making history, The ambitious project, called ”Icons,” started with a joke about copying one of the world’s most valuable photographs    Andreas Gursky’s Rhein II. When it was auctioned for $4. 3 million in 2011, the seemingly simple image of Germany’s River Rhein was the most expensive photograph ever sold.  The artistic duo have since recreated around a dozen more famous images over the last three years. When bringing to life Sam Shere’s 1937 photograph of the Hindenburg disaster, plumes of cotton wool were dramatically back lit with a light bulb to emulate the moment of explosion. Buzz Aldrin’s 1969 image of his own bootprint on the moon took a little more    from the inventive pair, who initially used sand, and then switched to concrete, to get the lunar texture just right. No small feat, The most   model of all, was Stuart Franklin’s 1989 ”Tank Man,” a picture which captured the eerie moment a lone figure obstructed the path of military tanks during student protests in Tiananmen Square. ”We bought the tanks on eBay from China,” explained Cortis. ”They were these model kits which we had to put together.” ”We had to build around seven or eight tanks    the first one was fun, the second one was ok, and then after that it was just hard work,” he said of the scene which took two weeks to complete. Capturing humanity, But by far the most challenging object to imitate is people    hence why their faces are so often obscured in Cortis and Sonderegger’s models. Ease of creation, rather than emotional attachment, has so far been the deciding factor when choosing a photograph.   That said, the artists still trawled through countless toy stores on their mission to find a figurine with the same toes as the hooded prisoner in the 2003 Abu Ghraib image. Meanwhile, the   kidnapper depicted in Ludwig Wegmann’s photograph of the 1972 Munich Olympics, was created with playdough and women’s stockings. Much like a doll’s house or ship in a bottle, perhaps part of the allure of these models is the wonder in real world objects shrunk to the palm of your hand. ”All these tiny things, I think everybody likes it,” agreed Cortis. ”Maybe it’s like remembering childhood when you played with little things.” Dark past, The pair have just finished making a miniature version of U. S. President John Kennedy’s 1963 assassination in Dallas, and Cortis is at a loss for words as to why so many of our   photographs are also some of humanity’s darkest. ”It’s not that we had it in our mind to recreate negative pictures. But I think there just seem to be more negative iconic pictures, than positive ones,” he said. ”But there is hope. History is still going on. And the project’s not finished yet.” A peek inside Europe’s most prestigious photography fair, Aerial photos capture the eerie photography of everyday life, Greatest building you’ll never see: 19 monuments lost in war",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43786,62738,Golf-ball diving: Lakes lined with $150K of ’white gold’,CNN,"<strong>Sheena McKenzie,</strong>",5/6/2015,2015,5,," (CNN) Dressed in a glistening wetsuit, and sitting behind the wheel of a golf cart, Sam Harrison admits he looks like the most absurd fish out of water you’ve ever seen. Get him in a lake, however, and the    is a   treasure hunter with the instinct of a shark, able to uncover his prey in zero visibility and   temperatures. In this case, the prey is golf balls. And with an estimated 300 million of the wayward white orbs lost in the U. S. alone each year, there is serious money to be made from their recovery    if you’re willing to take the plunge. Imagine swimming in a milkshake of silt. Now add weeds, broken bottles and every type of critter from leeches, to water snakes, even crocodiles, and you’ve pretty much got the idea of the perils of   diving. Making money from misfortune, For even the world’s best golfers, one of the most fearsome holes in sport will rear its watery head this week at the prestigious PLAYERS Championship in TPC Sawgrass, Florida    the infamous 17th hole. The ”Island Green,” as it is known, is a peninsula measuring just over 120 meters, completely surrounded by water. It’s a nightmare for players, and a potential gold mine for   divers. But for those unable to plunge the depths of Sawgrass’ bountiful lakes, is the job of   diving really worth the effort? ”On average, you’ll find 5, 000 balls per lake,” says Harrison, who    when not taking a leap of faith on Britain’s golf courses    can be found working as a banker in London.  ”Say we’re selling the balls we find at an average 50p (75 cents),” explains the   of Lake Ball Diving. ”That would give us £2, 500 ($3, 700),” said Harrison, estimating that in a year he could earn up to £100, 000 ($150, 000). It’s a similar story in America, according to Paul Lovelace, who has been diving for ”white gold” over the past three decades. ”I think everybody has a dream of diving for sunken treasure    and that’s basically what we’re doing every day,” says the    owner of Golf Ball Paul’s, who previously worked as a    diver on offshore oil rigs. ”It’s the thrill of the hunt.” The most prized catch of all is the Titleist Pro V1. Pluck a bagload of these premier balls from the bottom of a   lake, he says, and you know it’s a good day. ”A perfect Titleist? You can retail that for $2,” says Lovelace, speaking by phone from his Kansas warehouse, stacked high with bulky sacks of balls waiting to be washed and sorted for sale. But even before he or Harrison hit the water, there are significant outlay costs. On both sides of the pond (in this case, the Atlantic Ocean,) golf courses charge divers between   per ball they find. And that can quickly add up to hundreds of dollars. Nature calls, Once in the water, you’re lucky to see more than a foot in front of you, and Lovelace has one piece of advice for new divers: ”If you’re grabbing stuff down there and it’s not round    don’t pick it up!” ”In the Midwest we have snapping turtles, and they can take off fingers and hands and toes and other extremities if you’re not careful.” In other parts of the world, the risks are more extreme. Last year,    Jacques van der Sandt was killed by a crocodile after retrieving golf balls from a national park in South Africa. While in Florida,    Steve Martinez was bitten by an alligator while diving at a country club. In the UK, Harrison often comes face to face with water snakes. ”Sometimes you rough up the reeds and you can see one of them swimming towards you,” he says, adding that he’s usually   in pitch black darkness with nothing more than a fog light and a rake. But perhaps more worrying is the water itself. ”On some courses, the lakes are more like sewers,” he says. ”In those stagnant pools you can catch diseases, so you have to wear a head guard, a bit like an    wetsuit, so nothing can get on you.” One man’s trash, The bizarre array of objects buried at the bottom of a lake tell of woe on the sporting field. Not just the odd golf club hurled in anger, but entire bags    and even a motorized cart    have been found by divers. If you’re getting into this messy business because you enjoy scuba diving in tropical locales, you better think again, says Harrison. ”Don’t get me wrong, I’d much rather be diving in the Red Sea, seeing some picturesque fish than broken beer bottles,” he says. ”But overall I generally enjoy it. And you never know,” he adds, ”you might find a lake where you hit the jackpot.” Read: Tiger Woods hits new low, Watch: The world’ leading golf course architects ​",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44501,63465,Sports stadium architecture: Welcome to the new temples of pleasure,CNN,"<strong>Sheena McKenzie,</strong>",12/15/2014,2014,12,," (CNN) It’s a vision of biblical proportions    tens of thousands of people weeping, whooping, and chanting in unison. If sport were a religion, then the stadium would surely be its place of worship.  Inside these temples to physical feats, language evokes the divine    fearful fans ”pray for a miracle,” while losing prompts serious ” .”  So much so that architects these days must create more than a stage for human endurance. It’s as if they have been asked to perform the architectural equivalent of feeding the 5, 000 with five loaves and two fish    constructing an arena to elevate the senses, capture the spirit of a community, and become an icon for a city long after the last fan has passed through the turnstiles. ”It’s like creating a contemporary cathedral in some ways,” said Spela Videcnik, architect behind the   ”spotty” Borisov Arena, home to the Belarus national football team. ”Often the stadium is meant to become the pride of a city, a landmark object, and as such, a monument representing the latest achievements in architecture.” Since ancient Greeks built the first Olympic stadium in fine white marble, the arena has been as much about inspiring awe, as staging competition.  Today’s architects must go even further. Return to Roman times? In an age where sporting events are captured on television in brilliant detail, designers must lure us from the comfort of living rooms with multipurpose entertainment centers. No longer relegated to the outskirts of town, these   social hubs are creeping inside our metropolises once more    and they have more in common with historic cathedrals than you might think. ”Look at the ancient Greek and Roman stadiums    they’re very much in the middle of the city,” said Hubert Nienhoff, veteran German architect behind the redeveloped Berlin Olympic Stadium, and Amazon Arena at this year’s World Cup in Brazil. ”But in the last 50 years, the stadium became something that was not really integrated, they were built outside the cities. They were for people who went there perhaps once a week for an event.” While arenas like the Colosseum in the heart of Rome occupy real estate today’s architects could only dream of, we may soon see a return to centralized social spaces of old, says Nienhoff. ”Now we’re bringing in multiple uses for stadiums again, like shops and conference halls,” he said. ”In the future they will not be outside the city but, something like the cathedrals of the Middle Ages, they will be a vital part of city life.”  A key part of this vision, however, will depend on improved transport infrastructure. ”There was a trend back in the 1980s of treating stadiums a bit like shopping centers. So you’d try and put them on the edges of cities,” said architect Clive Lewis, designer behind the Singapore National Stadium and Sports Hub, and winner at this year’s World Architecture Festival award. ”But more and more it’s important to make a stadium that’s part of the city. They need to be integrated into the transport infrastructure, so they’re a naturally connected part of the city    the event should start as soon as you leave your house.” He goes one step further with a vision of one roof to house all of humanity. ”For me, stadiums have taken over the function of a cathedral. It’s a building that brings together people of all ages, all cultures, all religions. ”And the only other thing that comes close to that is an airport.” Lasting legacy, At the heart of an arena, both physically and spiritually, is its playing area. And with the outcome of multimillion dollar matches riding on everything from grass quality, to the position of the sun, designers must get it pitch perfect. Does that mean architects need to be sports fans themselves?  ”Do we need to be religious to build a church? We don’t think so,” comes the reply from Berger Architects, the company behind the brilliantly illuminated Luanda Multisports Pavilion in Angola. ”Architects must be able to project themselves, and think as if they were the final users of the space they’re designing.” And long after the grand final trophies have been handed out, an arena must serve its people for decades to come. ”Whether we’re designing for the Olympics or the World Cup, we’re always actually thinking ahead to what we’re going to do with the venue after that event,” said Lewis, whose Singapore Sports Hub hopes to hold 200 events every year. ”And I think there’s a history in recent years of relatively few examples that have done that very well.” Perhaps the most striking example of this failure is Athens.  The Greek capital may be the home of the modern Olympics, but over a century later, its 2004 stadia has become a modern ruin of its own, with venues overgrown with weeds, walls covered in graffiti, and seating rotted away.  It’s an   death for an event which cost the country around $11 billion to host. Entertainment plus, Step inside today’s stadiums, and you’ll find an entertainment juggernaut where fans are encouraged to dig deep into their pockets long before the first  . ”Over the last 50 years corporate interests have changed stadiums more than anything else. Years ago, stadiums were just bare concrete and no seats, just bleachers,” said Lewis. ”Today, it’s a lot more about the corporate experience    the internal lounge, corporate boxes, restaurants. Which means that people are coming to the venue an hour or two before the event and not leaving for an hour or two afterwards.” The goal for stadium owners is to create an icon for the city    one worthy of their name stamped across it in bright lights. ”The mayor asked us for something that would ’put Durban on the map,’” says Nienhoff of the Moses Mabhiba Stadium, in Durban, built for the 2010 South African World Cup. ”If you looked at Durban from the waterside, there was nothing you could remember specifically from the skyline.” That was before Neinhoff’s stark white arena was built on the coastline, its swooping 350 meter arched entrance and ruffled roof a sight to behold. Natural instinct, But before Nienhoff even puts pen to paper, one of the first places he looks for inspiration is nature. With its reptilian façade, the Amazon Arena, built in Manaus for the World up in Brazil this year, borrows much from the surrounding jungle. ”If you look into the structures of nature like a leaf, or the skin of a snake, there’s always a logical system behind it,” explained Nienhoff. ”Manaus is in the middle of a rainforest, so that’s where we turned for inspiration. We’re really trying to design something that’s only meant for this one place.” Like nature itself, these modern day temples of pleasure will also need to regenerate themselves, in order to survive.

43876,62828,Preakness Stakes: Five fun facts,CNN,"<strong>Sheena McKenzie,<strong></strong></strong>",5/17/2013,2013,5,," (CNN) It’s a dilemma 1960s TV character Jan Brady knew well: ”How do you stand out when you’re the middle sister?”  Indeed, her ranting against sophisticated elder sibling    ”Marcia, Marcia, Marcia”    became one of the most memorable catchphrases in the   U. S. sitcom The Brady Bunch. But the middle sister needn’t be overlooked.  In fact, if the Preakness Stakes    the second horse race in America’s prestigious Triple Crown    is anything to go by, sometimes the quiet ones have the greatest stories to tell. The Kentucky Derby may be the first and most famous of the trifecta    won by jockey Victor Espinoza atop American Pharoah earlier this month. But the Preakness, which is run in Baltimore this Saturday, also offers a fascinating history, unique atmosphere, and special significance in the march towards the third race in the crown, the Belmont Stakes.  Here are five fun reasons why the Preakness Stakes is one to watch: Silver service, The trophy is so valuable, not even the winners are allowed to hold it.  The mammoth   solid silver Woodlawn Vase, created by Tiffany and Co. in 1860, is worth $1 million    making it the most valuable trophy in American sports.  But the immense pressure of safeguarding it for an entire year was too much for the wife of 1953’s winning owner Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, who instead convinced her husband to leave it the hands of organizers. The trophy now remains on permanent display at the Baltimore Museum of Art, with winners instead given a $30, 000 replica trophy. Blooming ingenious, Sometimes if nature won’t bloom, you’ve just got to paint it yourself. So it goes for the iconic ”  Susan” blanket, traditionally draped across the shoulders of the winning horse. The blanket takes three days to create, featuring 80 bunches of normal yellow daisies strung together and attached to a rubber base, with the underside covered in thick felt. But because the   Susan    the official flower for the state of Maryland    doesn’t sprout until June, artists must instead paint the center of the daisies black. You’re so ’vane’ The paintwork continues atop Pimlico Race Course’s Old Clubhouse, where each year the weather vane is daubed in the winner’s colors. As soon as the race is over, the 1.  wide weather vane, featuring a miniature horse and jockey, is painted in the winning jockey’s silks. The unusual tradition started in 1909 after the building’s original   weather vane was struck by lightning and replaced with the ornamental iron rider. Sign painter Michael Willinger took on the job in 1987, saying: ”It is just the thrill of being able to participate in a big local and national event like this. Let’s face it, it’s the only televised   job in the country.” Family ties, If ever there was a big daddy of Preakness, Gallant Fox is it. The champion thoroughbred not only won the U. S. Triple Crown in 1930, he went on to sire the winners of more than 90 Preakness Stakes. It was a case of like father like son, when Gallant Fox’s offspring, Omaha, also won the Triple Crown in 1935. Gallant Fox won 11 of his 17 races, before retiring at the grand old age of three. The super stud died in 1954, aged 27.  Race adjourned, Still looking for proof that Preakness is a race that stops a nation? Look no further than the day it brought Government to a standstill. The U. S. House of Representatives adjourned for the only time in history in 1877, to watch what was known as the ”Great Race.” More than 20, 000 people flocked to Pimlico to watch three thoroughbreds    Parole, Ten Broeck and Tom Ochiltree    battle it out on the field.    gelding Parole triumphed, and local pool halls saloons and baseball clubs were renamed in his honor.

42467,61411,Emma Watson’s Facebook chat - International Women’s Day,CNN,<strong>Sheena McKenzie</strong>,3/6/2015,2015,3,," (CNN) British actress Emma Watson made an impassioned plea to women around the world: ”Don’t let anyone tell you what you can or cannot do, or cannot achieve. ”Just don’t allow it. It’s wrong. It’s so wrong. Be what you want to be    and prove them wrong.” The emotional Harry Potter star took to the stage at Facebook’s headquarters in London on Sunday, March 8, to talk about gender equality as part of International Women’s Day celebrations.  CNN was among the live audience of around 150 people    with millions more watching the live stream across the world    the    UN Goodwill Ambassador spoke about her own feminist journey. Emma’s Facebook moment  Of the dozens gathered at the event, the majority were bespectacled young men    not so unlike Harry Potter himself.  Describing the ”surreal” moment she gave a speech at U. N. headquarters, later watched by 17 million, Watson said:  ”Gender equality historically has been a woman’s movement.  ”And how it’s affecting men hasn’t been addressed,” she told moderator Greg James.   During the   conversation, Watson gave the audience a  rare glimpse into her private life    and the difference between chivalry and sexism. ”I love having the door opened for me, isn’t that just polite?” she said. ”But I think the key is, would you then mind me opening the door for you?” ”Chivalry should be consensual.” And it’s not just women affected by gender inequality    men suffer too, she added. ”I get disturbed by this idea that men can’t cry,” she continued.  ”They can’t express themselves and I think that’s the saddest thing in the world. Being able to express yourself is what makes you human    it’s not what makes you a girl.” When internet trolls threatened to release naked photos of the actress, following her UN speech, she said it only made her more determined in her campaign. ”If they were trying to put me off    they did the opposite,” she added. Almost 230, 000 men and boys across the world have since joined the HeForShe campaign, including U. S. President Barack Obama, and actors Joseph   and Matt Damon. ”I read a letter of support from a    boy that was equally as passionate as a CEO,” said Watson, adding that she often read their stories before going to bed at night. ”I asked my younger sister: ’What would be the one thing you’d want from boys in your life?’ She said: ’I just want them to play with us.’ And I think that really translates at every level. We just want to be included.” Watson also talked about the inspiring influence of her mother, Jacqueline, who was a ”single working mother and type one diabetic.” ”She wanted me to be my own person and said a bit of rebellion was good,” said Watson, adding: ”She was actually thrilled when I got my first detention. .. I think I failed a Latin exam.”  Answering questions submitted via Facebook, Watson said the recent lack of female representation at the Academy Awards showed that the fight for gender equality was far from over. ”Why are women not directing their own stories?” she said.  ”The human race is a bird    and it needs both its wings to fly. And at the moment one of its wings is clipped,” said Watson, paraphrasing famous American feminist, Gloria Steinem. When asked what things we can all do to affect change, the actress said it wasn’t necessarily about grand actions    but small ones. ”It’s everyday, it’s individual, it’s on a case by case basis,” she said. ”Whether it’s speaking up or trying to change the way someone else thinks about an issue.” In the audience, a man wearing a Hogwarts jumper asked Watson whether women should be paid the same as men, when they are more likely to take maternity leave.  She answered: ”I don’t think in the grand scheme of things [maternity leave] is going to hinder a woman being incredibly effective in her field. ”I think men should be equal partners in raising children.” Those missing out on a place still got watch it live on Watson’s Facebook page.

41501,60431,China air rage: Angry passengers open emergency exits,CNN,<strong>Steven Jiang</strong>,1/12/2015,2015,1,,"Beijing (CNN)  air rage is now served both hot and cold. Last month, a   Thai AirAsia flight was forced to return to Bangkok after a female Chinese passenger threw hot water on a flight attendant amid a heated argument between her boyfriend and the cabin crew over service. On Saturday, passengers on a plane departing Kunming Changshui International Airport in southwestern China, angry with the crew for turning off the   during the   process, opened three emergency exits just as their plane was pushing back from the gate.  The flight was canceled and 25 passengers onboard were detained. China Eastern Airlines flight MU2036, bound for Beijing, was already seven hours behind schedule at 3:45 a. m. when crew began to   the plane at the Kunming airport, which saw more than 100 flights delayed or canceled that night because of snowy weather. Frustrated by the lengthy delay, some of the 153 passengers    who had been sitting on the plane for two hours    exploded with rage when the   stopped and an elderly passenger complained about discomfort due to the stuffy cabin, airport police told state media Saturday night. Dissatisfied with the pilot’s explanation about the need for   to be off during the     process, members of a tour group started quarreling with the crew, according to police. When the Boeing   jet finally pushed back from the gate, three of its four    emergency exits suddenly popped open. Photos circulating on social media show two opened exits on the right side of the cabin with passengers still seated, as well as crews and police on board documenting evidence. Air rage and emergency exists: Stormy weeks in Chinese aviation, Anger common in   China, After detaining and questioning all 25 members of the tour group, the authorities announced that a male member of the group, prompted by a female tour guide, opened two exits on the right side.  Both were sent to jail for 15 days, while police continued to look for the person who opened the exit on the left side. As news of the incident spread, some Chinese Internet users sympathized with the perpetrators because of the delay, but many considered their punishment too lenient and suggested airlines should blacklist them for life. Air rage is a common sight in   China and Saturday’s episode was not the first dramatic incident involving irate passengers at Kunming airport.  One of the country’s busiest hubs, more than 32 million fliers passed through its terminal last year. In August 2012, 31 passengers from a   flight tried to stop other planes from leaving Kunming by forcing their way onto the tarmac and occupying a taxiway for half an hour,   Xinhua news agency reported. The following February, some 50 passengers from a canceled flight stormed several gates at the airport in an attempt to prevent other travelers from boarding their flights.  Police had to disperse the angry crowd with pepper spray, according to Xinhua. Exporting air rage, With the exponential growth of outbound tourism, Chinese travelers now seem to be exporting their air rage overseas as well, with several incidents resulting in flight delays or diversions recorded in recent years. In February 2012, a Chinese couple was kicked off their United flight from Guam to Shanghai, after they repeatedly yelled at a flight attendant and told her to ”shut up” when she tried to move their luggage in the overhead bin to accommodate other passengers. In September that year, a Swiss flight bound for Beijing was forced to return to Zurich when a fight broke out between two Chinese men over a reclined seat. In February 2014, a fight erupted between two groups of Chinese passengers before their flight could take off from the Thai resort island of Phuket, resulting in 29 people being taken off the plane. Then, in April, a Thai Airways   from Bangkok to Beijing turned bloody when a brawl involving three Chinese men broke out. During an official visit to the Maldives in September, President Xi Jinping personally asked Chinese tourists to behave themselves while traveling abroad. Last year the government released a lengthy list of do’s and don’ts aimed at turning Chinese travelers into ”civilized tourists.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41318,60200,Teen arrested for Hong Kong chalk protest,CNN,<strong>Vicky Wong</strong>,12/31/2014,2014,12,,"Hong Kong (CNN) A    girl in Hong Kong could be removed from her father’s care after she was arrested for drawing chalk flowers on a wall at one of the city’s   protest sites. The girl was arrested in the early hours of December 23 at a staircase leading to the Central Government Offices in the city’s Admiralty district and was detained by police for 17 hours, said Patricia Ho, the lawyer acting for the teen.  A judge ruled in a youth court on Monday that the girl should be sent to a children’s home for 20 days until January 19. On Wednesday, local media reported the girl was released from the children’s home on bail. The wall, known as the ”Lennon Wall,” was once covered with colorful   notes and messages of support for the recent   protests in Hong Kong. When the protests were cleared, the notes were removed as well. Protestors started placing notes on the wall as a show of defiance after police used tear gas on demonstrators at the start of the protest, which lead to a   occupation of the main road outside the Central Government Office. The wall was named after the late Beatles star John Lennon and contained messages of support for the protests and references to his song ”Imagine.” ’An innocent political prisoner’ Ho said the move was ”premature and disproportionate.” ”It wasn’t an application by the Social Welfare Department as it usually would be,” she said. ”Police threw in a bunch of facts they obtained about the family in a very superficial manner.” Meanwhile, the court is considering an application by Hong Kong police that she be removed from the care of her father who, according to Ho, is seriously hearing impaired and cannot understand the case. The move has angered activists student activist group Scholarism have set up a petition protesting the court ruling and some protestors have started drawing on the road as a protest outside the children’s home in Tuen Mun, where the teenager is being held. Gary Tsang, who participated in Hong Kong’s   street occupations, told CNN the teen was ”an innocent political prisoner” and the use of the law in this case was ”obviously politically motivated.” ”The government fears young people as they thinks young people have nothing to lose,” he said. Another protestor, Anson Chui, told CNN the police have lost their common sense and said there would be more similar arrests. ”Most (people). .. know that we cannot really cause any damage on the wall by drawing with chalk,” he said. ”It is just an excuse used by the police to make us fear. Especially when the court said they are taking away the girl from her father.” The move comes after police also made an application for a care or protection order for a teenage boy who was arrested during the clearance of another protest site in Mong Kok earlier this month. The court file said the boy’s parents failed to exercise proper guardianship over him.  The court dates for both teenagers will take place in January.  Continued resistance, A small protest camp outside the Legislative Council still remains and there is a small police presence on the site. Police officers are guarding Lennon Wall and remove all notes posted to it at the end of each day. New Year’s Eve countdown events at popular shopping districts such as Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui were canceled because of fears that protestors would attempt to hijack the events.  Since the protest sites were cleared, demonstrators have resorted to other forms of protest such as the   ”shopping revolution,” which involves protestors blocking the sidewalks and flooding shopping districts every night with yellow umbrellas. Hong Kong Police have not responded to requests for comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39011,57861,James O’Neill: NYC blast comes on top cop’s first day on the job,CNN,<sub>Tiffany Ap</sub>,9/18/2016,2016,9,," (CNN) For New York’s newest police commissioner James O’Neill, the Chelsea explosion was his initiation into the new job.  The blast, which wounded 29 people on Saturday night, and the discovery of a pressure cooker device set the city on edge on what should’ve been a vibrant night on Manhattan’s west side.   New York blast ’obviously an act of terrorism,’ governor says, At the late night news conference where authorities announced their initial findings, O’Neill took the mic to reassure residents the NYPD was on full alert and an investigation underway.  But his was an unfamiliar face to most. Saturday marked his first full day on the job as the city’s 43rd commissioner, succeeding William Bratton.  O’Neill was sworn in Friday     Bratton’s last day on the job.  So just who is the man who oversees the largest police department in the United States? He’s a   police veteran  O’Neill has over three decades of experience with the force, first beginning his career in 1983 with the transit police.  ”He credits his time on patrol on the trains and platforms of the subway system with helping him learn how to interact and communicate with a wide range of people, a skill he regards as essential to successful police work,” the NYPD website says.  He gradually rose through the ranks, including as commanding officer of the 25th, 44th and Central Park precincts, followed by chief of patrol. In 2014, he was named chief of department, the NYPD’s highest uniformed rank, before replacing Bratton.  He’s from New York  Flatbush, Brooklyn to be exact. He grew up as one of seven children, later attending John Jay College. He’s known to go by ”Jim” or ”Jimmy.” He has two sons, Daniel and Christopher, and is described by the NYPD as an ”avid hockey player and motorcyclist.” Crime down but challenges ahead, He’s inherited a record low crime rate, thanks to Bratton’s tenure, but will have to grapple with other significant challenges, especially surrounding issues of race and terrorism.  O’Neill has a demonstrated track record when it comes to racial relations. He pioneered the idea of neighborhood policing, or building relationships between police officers and the community to increase trust    and not long after stepping up to Chief of Department, he handled the protests around Eric Garner’s death and the subsequent assassinations of two detectives.  He’s said he will focus on reconnecting the police force and residents.  ”Fighting crime is what we get paid to do,” O’Neill said, according to the NYPD website. ”But we can’t do that unless we achieve full partnership with the community. Unless we have that connectivity, it’s not going to work.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
630,17991,Review: Matthew McConaughey Mines Profane Capitalism in ‘Gold’ - The New York Times,New York Times,A. O. Scott,1/27/2017,2017,1,,"Kenny Wells, the feckless owner of a Nevada mining company, is the latest entry in the Matthew McConaughey gallery of charming rogues. Swaybacked and paunchy, with a thinning dome and an appetite for Winstons and Seagram’s that would keep both brands in business if the rest of the world went cold turkey, Kenny doesn’t quite have the wolfish charisma or the mystical intensity of some of Mr. McConaughey’s other recent characters. But like them  —   like Mick Haller in “The Lincoln Lawyer,” Ron Woodroof in “Dallas Buyers Club” and that guy in those car commercials  —   he is fun to watch and hard not to root for. “Gold,” which chronicles a few of Kenny’s rises and falls in the 1980s, describes itself as “inspired by actual events,” but inspiration is precisely what the film, directed by Stephen Gaghan from a script by Patrick Massett and John Zinman, seems to lack. Mr. McConaughey is a ball of profane, entrepreneurial energy bouncing around in a vacuum. The story swings from the Nevada desert to the Indonesian rain forest to Wall Street boardrooms, and the screen bristles with signifiers of capitalist activity: meetings, phone calls, stock tickers. But the movie isn’t really doing any work. It’s just looking busy. Having nearly run the family prospecting business into the ground (so to speak) Kenny gambles on the expertise of a Mike Acosta (Édgar Ramírez) a geologist with an almost mystical reputation. They strike gold in Indonesia, and a gilded future opens up for Kenny and his longtime girlfriend, Kaylene (Bryce Dallas Howard). There are shadows and complications, of course, including the corruptions of wealth, the treachery of rivals and Kenny’s own impulsiveness. Broad hints are dropped that things will end badly. But enough goes wrong along the way  —   with the movie, I mean, not with Mike and Kenny’s scheme  —   to make the outcome feel almost moot. The film is well cast: You can’t really go wrong with Bill Camp, Corey Stoll, Stacy Keach and Bruce Greenwood. It’s beautifully shot (you can’t go wrong with Robert Elswit, either). There is a pleasingly sleazy, swaggering,   ’80s vibe. And there are flickering reminders of other ambitious,   mock epics, as if the filmmakers were hoping an algorithm would deposit “Gold” in the queues of viewers who liked “American Hustle,” “The Big Short” and Mr. Gaghan’s own “Syriana. ” With this material, he could have gone in any number of interesting directions, which may have been part of the problem. “Gold” could have been a biting satire of greed and folly, a   tale of Western misadventure in Asia, a rousing fable of underdog triumph or a caper comedy. It tries, in its frantic, clumsy fashion, to be all of those things, and comes close enough to succeeding to qualify as an honorable failure. What holds your attention is the question of whether that description fits Kenny as well. He could just as well be the opposite  —   a dishonorable success. He is far from a subtle guy, but Mr. McConaughey is a sly enough actor to make us wonder whether we’re in the company of a fool or a con artist and to make us question whether there’s really a difference. His wild, abrasive and improbably delicate performance is what makes “Gold” watchable, even if the rest of the movie doesn’t supply sufficient reason to keep watching.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
826,18228,Review: ‘I Am Not Your Negro’ Will Make You Rethink Race - The New York Times,New York Times,A. O. Scott,2/3/2017,2017,2,,"A few weeks ago, in reaction to something we had written about blackness and whiteness in recent movies, my colleague Manohla Dargis and I received a note from a reader. “Since when is everything about race?” he wanted to know. Perhaps it was a rhetorical question. A flippant  —   though by no means inaccurate  —   answer would have been 1619. But a more constructive response might have been to recommend Raoul Peck’s   new documentary, “I Am Not Your Negro. ” Let me do so now, for that reader (if he’s still interested) and for everybody else, too. Whatever you think about the past and future of what used to be called “race relations”  —   white supremacy and the resistance to it, in plainer English  —   this movie will make you think again, and may even change your mind. Though its principal figure, the novelist, playwright and essayist James Baldwin, is a man who has been dead for nearly 30 years, you would be   to find a movie that speaks to the present moment with greater clarity and force, insisting on uncomfortable truths and drawing stark lessons from the shadows of history. To call “I Am Not Your Negro” a movie about James Baldwin would be to understate Mr. Peck’s achievement. It’s more of a posthumous collaboration, an uncanny and thrilling communion between the filmmaker  —   whose previous work includes both a documentary and a narrative feature about the Congolese   leader Patrice Lumumba  —   and his subject. The   narration (read by Samuel L. Jackson) is entirely drawn from Baldwin’s work. Much of it comes from notes and letters written in the   when Baldwin was somewhat reluctantly sketching out a book, never to be completed, about the lives and deaths of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Reflections on those men (all of whom Baldwin knew well) and their legacies are interspersed with passages from other books and essays, notably “The Devil Finds Work,” Baldwin’s 1976 meditation on race, Hollywood and the mythology of white innocence. His published and unpublished words  —   some of the most powerful and penetrating ever assembled on the tortured subject of American identity  —   accompany images from old talk shows and news reports, from classic movies and from our own decidedly    present. Baldwin could not have known about Ferguson and Black Lives Matter, about the presidency of Barack Obama and the recrudescence of white nationalism in its wake, but in a sense he explained it all in advance. He understood the deep, contradictory patterns of our history, and articulated, with a passion and clarity that few others have matched, the psychological dimensions of racial conflict: the suppression of black humanity under slavery and Jim Crow and the insistence on it in   politics and art the dialectic of guilt and rage, forgiveness and denial that distorts relations between black and white citizens in the North as well as the South the lengths that white people will go to wash themselves clean of their complicity in oppression. Baldwin is a double character in Mr. Peck’s film. The elegance and gravity of his formal prose, and the gravelly authority of Mr. Jackson’s voice, stand in contrast to his quicksilver   presence as a lecturer and television guest. In his skinny tie and narrow suit, an omnipresent cigarette between his fingers, he imports a touch of midcentury intellectual cool into our overheated,   media moment. A former child preacher, he remained a natural, if somewhat reluctant, performer  —   a master of the heavy sigh, the raised eyebrow and the rhetorical flourish. At one point, on “The Dick Cavett Show,” Baldwin tangles with Paul Weiss, a Yale philosophy professor who scolds him for dwelling so much on racial issues. The initial spectacle of mediocrity condescending to genius is painful, but the subsequent triumph of   brilliance over credentialed ignorance is thrilling to witness. In that exchange, as in a speech for an audience of British university students, you are aware of Baldwin’s profound weariness. He must explain himself  —   and also his country  —   again and again, with what must have been sorely tested patience. When the students erupt in a standing ovation at the end of his remarks, Baldwin looks surprised, even flustered. You glimpse an aspect of his personality that was often evident in his writing: the vulnerable, bright, ambitious man thrust into a public role that was not always comfortable. “I want to be an honest man and a good writer,” he wrote early in his career, in the introductory note to his first collection of essays, “Notes of a Native Son. ” The disarming, intimate candor of that statement characterized much of what would follow, as would a reckoning with the difficulties of living up to such apparently straightforward aspirations. Without sliding into confessional bathos, his voice was always personal and frank, creating in the reader a feeling of complicity, of shared knowledge and knowing humor. “I Am Not Your Negro” reproduces and redoubles this effect. It doesn’t just make you aware of Baldwin, or hold him up as a figure to be admired from a distance. You feel entirely in his presence, hanging on his every word, following the implications of his ideas as they travel from his experience to yours. At the end of the movie, you are convinced that you know him. And, more important, that he knows you. To read Baldwin is to be read by him, to feel the glow of his affection, the sting of his scorn, the weight of his disappointment, the gift of his trust. Recounting his visits to the South, where he reported on the civil rights movement and the murderous white response to it, Baldwin modestly described himself as a witness, a watchful presence on the sidelines of tragedy and heroism, an outsider by virtue of his Northern origins, his sexuality and his alienation from the Christianity of his childhood. But he was also a prophet, able to see the truths revealed by the contingent, complicated actions of ordinary people on both sides of the conflict. This is not to say that he transcended the struggle or detached himself from it. On the contrary, he demonstrated that writing well and thinking clearly are manifestations of commitment, and that irony, skepticism and a ruthless critical spirit are necessary tools for effective moral and political action. “I Am Not Your Negro” is a thrilling introduction to his work, a remedial course in American history, and an advanced seminar in racial politics  —   a concise, roughly   movie with the scope and impact of a     or a literary doorstop. It is not an easy or a consoling movie, but it is the opposite of bitter or despairing. “I can’t be a pessimist because I’m alive,” Baldwin said. “I’m forced to be an optimist. ”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3363,21014,Review: ‘Star Trek Beyond’ Sticks to Its Brand. That’s Not Necessarily Bad. - The New York Times,New York Times,A. O. Scott,7/22/2016,2016,7,,"Musing in his Captain’s Log as his birthday approaches, James Tiberius Kirk, his eyes as blue as the lens flare that accompanies the first shot of the Starship Enterprise, finds himself in a funk. “Things are starting to feel a little   …     episodic,” he confesses, in what even a sympathetic viewer might interpret as a   a confession of franchise fatigue. Chris Pine, who has played Kirk since the   reboot in 2009, is on his third voyage. This character, originated by William Shatner, has endured a lot more. The larger “Star Trek” enterprise has been boldly going on for a   and more hours of television and cinema than I possess the Googling acumen to tally. So you can understand why James T. a good soldier and also a bit of a loose cannon, might want to break out of the rut, and the title of the latest movie, “Star Trek Beyond,” teases the audience with the promise of novelty and risk. It’s not necessarily a criticism to note that not much materializes. Directed by the action maven Justin Lin from a script by Simon Pegg and Doug Jung, the film answers the question “Beyond what?” with a diffident “Well, nothing, really. Don’t worry!” It should have been called “Star Trek Within” in honor of its determination to color inside the lines, obeying the ironclad conventions of brand and genre. Which is not, in itself, a bad thing. Not every wheel needs reinventing, and one of the abiding pleasures of “Star Trek,” in its old and newer iterations, lies in its balance of stubborn consistency and canny inventiveness. The characters never change, but the stakes can shift wildly from one adventure to the next. Fans love “Star Trek” precisely because of its episodic nature, which allows for a certain amount of variation in theme and tone. Sometimes the future of the universe hangs in the balance. Sometimes Kirk and his crew have to deal with local disputes and personnel issues. Or weird random stuff, like tribbles or Joan   time travel. Unfortunately,     action movies are made according to a more rigid template, and “Beyond” follows its immediate predecessors, “Star Trek” and “Into Darkness” (both directed by J. J. Abrams) in sacrificing some of the old spirit to blockbuster imperatives. The Hollywood rule book stipulates that the climactic sequence should involve the noisy destruction of a lot of buildings and an extended    fight between the good guy and the main villain. The villain should be motivated by the usual villainous grudge. Millions of lives should be in danger, and the actual casualties should be numerous and filmed bloodlessly enough to preserve the   rating. Up until the tedious and bombastic finish, though, you can have a pretty good time. In his work on the “Fast and Furious” movies, Mr. Lin has shown a playful willingness to extend  —   and, if necessary, suspend  —   the laws of physics, and his visual brashness can be a refreshing antidote to Mr. Abrams’s fussy tries to combine digital spectacle with   cinematic discipline. Most important, the gang’s all here, and Mr. Lin proves once again to be an adept ensemble wrangler. Kirk grins and grimaces his way through yet another existential career crisis (and also does some motorcycle stunt driving). Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) experience some love trouble. Spock and Bones (Karl Urban) take their   vaudeville double act on the road once again. Sulu (John Cho) Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and Scotty (Mr. Pegg) provide technical support and comic relief, as necessary. Mr. Yelchin’s sweet, mischievous performance seems especially poignant after his death in an accident this year. The film is dedicated to his memory and to the memory of Leonard Nimoy, the original Mr. Spock, who died in 2015. On the surface of a distant planet, the crew encounters a new nemesis and a new ally. The big baddie is a murderous warlord named Krall (Idris Elba, masked). The scrappy sidekick is a stranded fighter named Jaylah (Sofia Boutella, in   makeup). Things go more or less as you expect, with enough surprises and “reveals” to make you mad at me if I say too much more. The crew hops into, and out of, danger. Machinery fails and is repaired in the nick of time. Highly complicated imaginary science is explained with breathless urgency. Sometimes, I have to say, the scientific breakthroughs feel a little too convenient. Jaylah has some kind of technology that makes giant spaceships invisible, and another kind that shoots   resin (or something). And there is some business at the end on an enormous space station that I did not buy for a minute. The nerd in me wants a bit more rigor, a bit more plausibility underneath the exuberant fakery. Maybe in the next episode. “Star Trek Beyond” is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned). Nothing out of the ordinary.

3648,21334,Review: ‘Morris From America’: A 13-Year-Old Stranger in a Strange Land - The New York Times,New York Times,A. O. Scott,8/22/2016,2016,8,,"“Morris From America,” Chad Hartigan’s charming new film, begins with a   discussion of   an argument about beats, flows and hooks. It’s partly an affectionate intergenerational dispute    Morris (Markees Christmas) is skeptical of his father’s   dogma, while his dad, Curtis (Craig Robinson) dismisses his son’s taste as too pop. The conversation also provides a clue about the movie’s own strategies. It’s a pop confection with a rough, honest texture, real but not raw and suffused with an infectious sweetness that lingers after the final shot. As Curtis puts it, he and Morris are “the only brothers in Heidelberg,” an   family in the perplexing and sometimes unfriendly environment of a picturesque German town. Curtis, a former soccer player in the United States, is on the coaching staff of the local team, and the rest of his back story is conveniently blurry. Like almost every other single dad you see in a movie, he is a widower, a shortcut to audience sympathy that Mr. Hartigan might have had the wit to avoid. But the novelty of the setting and the familiarity of the premise  —   an adolescent boy navigating a bumpy stretch on the road from boyhood to maturity  —   combine to give “Morris From America” buoyancy and heart. Mr. Christmas is an unusually subtle actor for someone his age. (He was 15 when the film was made.) He resists the temptation to make Morris precocious or cute, or to win over the viewer’s sympathy, and instead takes us inside the young man’s confusion. Like other teenagers, Morris is both smart and clueless, equally capable of sharp insights and colossal errors of judgment. Adding to his befuddlement is Katrin (Lina Keller) a slightly older girl (with a significantly older boyfriend) whom Morris meets at the youth center. He’s been encouraged to go there by his German tutor, Inka (Carla Juri) who serves, somewhat awkwardly, as his   and surrogate big sister. Katrin, a cynical and capricious queen bee, is beautiful and more than a little cruel. She genuinely likes Morris, which means that she likes to humiliate and torment him. She encourages him to rap at the center’s talent show, with disastrous results. “Morris From America” is blunt about German racism, which has a different texture from its American variety, partly because young,   Germans consider themselves entirely free of ancestral bigotry. A counselor at the youth center suspects that Morris is a drug dealer. The other kids blithely give voice to obnoxious assumptions about his basketball skills and his sexual prowess. He’s either a mascot or a scapegoat. Without minimizing the pain and injustice of Morris’s situation, Mr. Hartigan, whose previous features as a director are “This Is Martin Bonner” and “Erin and Brie Are on a First Date,” handles the film’s racial dimensions with a gentle touch. The movie’s most satisfying achievement is its sense of proportion. There is plenty of drama in a teenager’s everyday life  —   no need to sensationalize  —   and “Morris From America” feels true to both the pleasures and the frustrations of its title character. And let’s not forget about Curtis. Mr. Robinson, who has long been a stalwart supporting player in   and   comedies, has my vote for father of the year. If there is anything harder than being a    boy, it’s living with one, and Mr. Robinson and Mr. Hartigan nail the particular challenges of that condition as well as anyone I can think of. Curtis, who has his own emotional and professional needs, must juggle an expanding number of conflicting duties. He’s supposed to be a role model and a pal, to set limits and set his son free, to leave the boy alone and to be there when he’s required. Morris and Curtis live in a state of mutual bewilderment, but the love between them is the beat that drives the movie’s flow. The authenticity of some of the rapping means that “Morris From America” has an R rating, but if you know someone Morris’s age and swearing is not a   for you, this is a perfect movie to see together as the new school year approaches. “Morris From America” is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

4084,21818,"Review: In ‘Queen of Katwe,’ a Pawn Finds Her Crown Through Chess - The New York Times",New York Times,A. O. Scott,2/21/2017,2017,2,,"“Irresistible” is one of those adjectives that critics should handle with utmost care. No matter how universally charming or winning a movie or a performance might seem to be, there is always a chance that somebody, somewhere, will be able to resist it. For all I know that may be the case with “Queen of Katwe,” but if there is anyone out there capable of remaining unmoved by this       sports story, I don’t think I want to meet that person. To be fair, the film, directed by Mira Nair, based on Tim Crothers’s book and enabled by the magical corporate synergy of Disney and ESPN, belongs to a genre that specializes in defeating skepticism and swelling the stoniest hearts. Just as surely as a creaky door or a clap of thunder will summon shivers of fright the thousandth time you hear it, so will the spectacle of a scrappy group of strivers following their unlikely coach to victory bring lumps to throats and tears to eyes. Did “Hoosiers” make you cry? “Queen of Katwe” will wreck you. Katwe is a poor township outside of Kampala, the Ugandan capital, and it is the hometown of Phiona Mutesi, a chess prodigy played by Madina Nalwanga in her film debut. Phiona lives with three siblings under the watchful, tired eye of their mother, Nakku Harriet (Lupita Nyong’o) who has lost her husband and another child and who scratches out a living selling food on the street. The family never has enough money, and Uganda is depicted as a country of stark inequalities ruled by an unforgiving cash economy. Shelter, schooling, medical treatment and transportation to the hospital after an accident must be paid for up front. Harriet, her mouth a permanent frown, is nearly consumed by worry and fatigue. Her eldest daughter, Night (Taryn Kyaze) has taken up with an unsavory guy on a motorbike. The middle children, Phiona and her younger brother, Brian (Martin Kabanza) scarcely have enough to eat. Chess enters their world thanks to Robert Katende (David Oyelowo) who teaches the game to Katwe’s children as part of a youth ministry. Robert, whose own youth was scarred by poverty and war, has an engineering degree but lacks the connections that would help land him a job working for the government or a private company. He is an inspiring coach  —   when Mr. Oyelowo wants to inspire you, you are darn well going to be inspired  —   and also a sly and cheerful class warrior. He   his way into a chess tournament held at a snooty private school, and proudly leads his charges into battle against opponents who are reluctant to shake their hands. The sight of     schoolboys beaten by a girl  —   a poor girl, at that  —   would be satisfying even if “Queen of Katwe” were a less vivid and engaging movie. In Ms. Nair’s hands, Phiona’s story has a richness and unpredictability that separates it from other, superficially similar movies. It also has the buoyant, cleareyed feel for the particulars of culture and place that is among this director’s great gifts, evident in films as different as “Mississippi Masala,” “Monsoon Wedding” and “Vanity Fair. ” Phiona’s circumstances are harsh, and the film hardly minimizes the brutal choices and painful limitations placed on women like Harriet and Night. Nor does it suggest that winning chess matches is a magical solution to the world’s injustice. “Hope is not a tactic,” Robert likes to say. But despair is not a strategy, and Ms. Nair and the screenwriter, William Wheeler, refuse to turn African life into a pageant of grimness and deprivation. “Queen of Katwe” is likely to be embraced by young viewers, and there is nothing here they won’t be able to handle. Adults, meanwhile, can surrender to some   melodramatic pleasures, as the busy plot takes in Harriet and Robert’s struggles as well as Phiona’s. But in the end it is Ms. Nalwanga who will rivet all eyes in the way that untrained, naturally charismatic screen performers sometimes can, especially when supported by actors with the technical expertise of Ms. Nyong’o and Mr. Oyelowo. Ms. Nalwanga’s watchful, quiet presence conveys both shyness and determination, a habit of humility in tension with an almost superhuman intelligence. Phiona’s awakening sense of her talent is the engine that drives the main plot of “Queen of Katwe” and also what makes it an affecting character study. When she starts to learn chess, she can barely read, and her growing awareness of the powers of her mind is thrilling to watch. Ms. Nair makes this process as visible, as palpable  —   as irresistible  —   as any boxing match or soccer game. “Queen of Katwe” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A few scary moments and hints of sexuality.

4513,22284,Review: ‘Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk’: Ang Lee’s Super-High-Definition Take on the Iraq War - The New York Times,New York Times,A. O. Scott,11/18/2016,2016,11,,"In 2004, George W. Bush was in the White House, Beyoncé was in Destiny’s Child and more than 100, 000 American troops were in Iraq. Whether or not this could be called a more innocent time, innocence is the central idea  —   the premise, the moral, the scarlet letter and the white whale  —   of “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk,” which takes place in that    year. Directed by Ang Lee and adapted from Ben Fountain’s novel, a National Book Award finalist in 2012, the movie is dominated by the baby blues and shy smile of its title character, an Army specialist from a small town in Texas. Billy (Joe Alwyn) and the other surviving members of Bravo Company, having endured a hellish firefight in Iraq, find themselves in equally surreal if less perilous circumstances back in the U. S. A. where they have been conscripted into the halftime show of a Thanksgiving Day professional football game. They are warmly applauded for their service and also callously exploited, fodder for a spectacle that collapses the difference between patriotic sentiment and gross commercialism. The audience’s attention swivels back and forth between the theater of battle and the arena of American   pop culture, pausing for quieter moments backstage, in the barracks and at Billy’s childhood home. A genial kid  —   he’s all of 19, and still a virgin  —   with a friendly manner and an understated sense of humor, Billy is the kind of person everyone seems to like. The officers in charge of his unit, the sarcastic taskmaster Dime (Garrett Hedlund) and the mystical warrior Shroom (Vin Diesel) regard him with   fondness. He is popular with the other men, especially Montoya (whose nickname is Mango). Something about him inspires special devotion from his sister Kathryn (Kristen Stewart) and catches the eye of a cheerleader named Faison (Makenzie Leigh). That’s a lot of people, and I haven’t even mentioned Albert (Chris Tucker) the movie guy who is trying to sell the story of the Bravos to Hollywood, or Norm Oglesby (Steve Martin) the Texas real estate mogul and   owner who is the Bravos’ host. Billy’s dealings with everyone  —   earnest conversations punctuated by flurries of boyish banter and bursts of intense action  —   give the movie a pleasantly hectic rhythm, but also thin out its emotions. The book is propelled by the breakneck velocity and scattershot jokiness of Mr. Fountain’s prose, but neither frenzy nor insouciance is exactly Mr. Lee’s speed. He is an elegant, contemplative filmmaker, observing strong emotions with a careful balance of sympathy and detachment. And even the chaos of combat and the circus inside the stadium have a choreographed, almost serene quality. You are not immersed in Billy’s world or his consciousness, but floating through them, with your eyes and ears open for small, significant details. There are enough of these to make watching “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” absorbing. The clarity of the digital cinematography (by John Toll) and the precision of the production design (by Mark Friedberg) incite a hundred small acts of noticing, and the script (by   Castelli) is attentive to the book’s cacophony of idioms. The movie is being released in two forms: a      version with an accelerated frame rate in a couple of theaters and a more conventional version everywhere else. The   edition, which was screened at the New York Film Festival, is a fascinating failed experiment, an attempt to bring Billy’s drama to life with unprecedented immediacy that falls into an uncanny valley between cinema and virtual reality. The images are, somewhat paradoxically, so   that their artificiality becomes more pronounced you feel as if you’re sitting uncomfortably close to the costumed holograms of famous actors. In more traditional moviegoing conditions the paradox runs in the other direction. The smoothness of the camerawork and the deliberateness of the dialogue make “Billy Lynn” feel more like a filmed play than an adapted novel, despite the verisimilitude of the settings. The acting, in   and medium shots, has a studied, stagy quality. Too often, you can hear the writing when the actors speak. But the median quality of both the writing and the acting is pretty high. Ms. Stewart, in just a few scenes, proves once again that she is one of the most interesting screen actresses of her generation, and you may wish that more of the movie was about Kathryn. It is a pleasure to encounter Mr. Diesel in his   mode, and to be in the peppery presence of the underrated Mr. Hedlund. And also to witness Mr. Lee’s ability to serve the ideas of a literary source. “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” is about the gulf that separates modern soldiers from their noncombatant fellow citizens, a rift that is the subject of books like Phil Klay’s “Redeployment” and Sebastian Junger’s “Tribe. ” The film is also, like Mr. Lee’s “Brokeback Mountain,” about love among men. The bonds in this case are comradely rather than erotic, but they are no less deep for that reason, and are stronger than anything else, including patriotism, family loyalty and heterosexual romance. This is not exactly a rare   notion, but “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” explores it with gentleness rather than sentimental bombast. The satire may be a little too gentle, but there is something disarmingly tender about the way Mr. Lee dramatizes young Billy’s predicament. You may be surprised at how sweet this movie is and also, in retrospect, startled by how bleak its vision turns out to be. “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for bloody combat, profanity and sexual longing. Running time: 1 hour 52 minutes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4671,22464,"Review: ‘Allied,’ With Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, Uncorks a Favorite Vintage - The New York Times",New York Times,A. O. Scott,12/2/2016,2016,12,,"“Allied,” Robert Zemeckis’s deft and diverting World War II romantic thriller, operates a bit like “Casablanca” in reverse. It’s about how the problems in this crazy world don’t amount to a hill of beans next to the troubles of two people in love. The singing of “La Marseillaise” figures prominently and tearfully in the plot. The city of Casablanca itself functions for the lovers, played by Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, much in the way that Paris does for Ilsa and Rick. It’s the scene of their first bliss, the place they’ll always have when things get complicated elsewhere. I don’t want to press the comparison too far. For one thing, there is more Alfred Hitchcock than Michael Curtiz in this movie’s DNA. For another, whereas “Casablanca” put forth a     call to arms, “Allied” offers the comforts of elegant escapism. Its moral complexities and political ambiguities are intriguing rather than troubling, its ethical and emotional agonies a diversion from rather than a reflection of our own. Which is just fine with me. There are nits to pick, of course. Mr. Pitt, playing a Canadian wing commander in the Royal Air Force, has apparently drawn inspiration from the trees in the great forests of the North. He is handsome, trim and efficient, but the same might be said of a wooden canoe, and his character’s stoical reserve often feels more like an empty space than a deep pool of untapped feeling. This changes toward the end, but the final minutes of “Allied” also provide some grounds for complaint. They are puffy and sentimental, the cinematic equivalent of a cloying dessert following an otherwise   meal. If I may pursue the culinary metaphor, and supplement it with a different comparison: “Allied,” while neither haute cuisine or haute couture, is like an expertly tailored suit or a properly cooked classic dish. It’s not so much a work of art as a triumph of craft, and therefore a reminder of the deep pleasures of   technique and long experience. Mr. Zemeckis has made more ambitious, more dazzling films  —   as a dogmatic   my list of favorites would include “Back to the Future,” “Who Framed Roger Rabbit” and “Cast Away”  —   but this one may be the purest and most relaxed demonstration of his mastery. Like Steven Spielberg’s “Bridge of Spies,” it infuses a venerable genre and a familiar period with new interest. The first shot, of Mr. Pitt’s character, Max Vatan, parachuting into the Moroccan desert, is hypnotically beautiful and strange. Your eye keeps recalibrating the perspective, anticipating Max’s touchdown when he is still far above the ground and then blinking in surprise when he finally lands. The rest of the film produces a similar effect, teasing your expectations and concealing cards in its impeccable sleeves. Once in Casablanca, Max is introduced to Marianne Beauséjour, a French resistance fighter who is his partner on a dangerous mission. Their orders are to pretend that they are married, and they end up giving themselves wholeheartedly to the performance, and to each other. Marianne explains that part of her method is to make sure that, whatever the details of the imposture, the feeling is real. That assertion will haunt the second half of the movie, which follows the couple to London. At this point I’m reluctant  —   though not as reluctant as some of the trailers  —   to say more. “Allied” is, among other things, a marvel of structure, a perfectly bifurcated story that manages a drastic shift in tone with exquisite aplomb. Max and Marianne set up house in Hampstead she gives birth to a daughter during an air raid he commutes to a mostly deskbound job, and the audience is free to appreciate the work of a superb supporting cast that includes Jared Harris, Lizzy Caplan and Simon McBurney. Ordinary life during wartime  —   a shuffle of tedium and hysteria, bureaucratic entanglement and everyday pleasures  —   is evoked in fine detail. Mr. Zemeckis and the screenwriter, Steven Knight, plant almost imperceptible clues that blossom into sinister and scary possibilities in a way that is both shocking and satisfying. You have an itchy premonition that something terrible is going to happen, and when it does the itch is scratched. “Standard operating procedure for intimate betrayal” is a military catchphrase that haunts “Allied,” a plausible portrait of a midcentury marriage that is also a fantastical piece of  ’oeil storytelling. Ms. Cotillard, in a remarkable series of frocks, hats, coats and trouser suits, is the key to the film’s spell. Is Marianne a stylized   feminine ideal, or a film noir femme fatale  —   or something else entirely, a modern woman decked out in Hollywood   ? You would not mistake this for an old movie. The language is too raw, the sexuality too frank, the politics too cloudy. But you might nonetheless feel like an older kind of moviegoer while you’re watching it: an adult, for one thing, whose intelligence is respected by an intricate, thematically thorny plot even as your thirst for visceral excitement is slaked by clean and breathless action sequences. You also get to look at beautiful people in (and half out of) beautiful clothes. The fundamental things apply. “Allied” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). I’m shocked  —   shocked  —   to find swearing, sex and smoking going on in this establishment.

4714,22515,"Review: ‘Lion’ Brings Tears for a Lost Boy, Wiped Dry by Google - The New York Times",New York Times,A. O. Scott,4/6/2017,2017,4,,"The first part of “Lion,” Garth Davis’s unabashedly   movie about a remarkable   incident, has some of the scary, wondrous feeling of a fairy tale. The audience is invited to imagine a   time  —   1986, to be precise  —   before social media or smartphones or Google. In those days, a person could get lost, which is just what happens to a little boy named Saroo (Sunny Pawar) who accidentally travels more than 1, 000 miles from his home in central India to the streets of Calcutta. Saroo’s mother (Priyanka Bose) is a laborer in a poor village. He and his beloved older brother, Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) supplement her meager wages with whatever casual work they can find. In the first scene, they are scavenging lumps of coal to exchange for milk at the market. Later, Saroo follows Guddu to a railroad station, where the younger boy accidentally boards an    train that takes him to a city full of strangers who speak a different language. With minimal dialogue and graceful editing, Mr. Davis and the screenwriter Luke Davies convey the Dickensian dimensions of Saroo’s situation. He is small and vulnerable, but also smart and resourceful, and even as he is exposed to horrifying cruelty, he is also a hero on an adventure. The enormous pain of his loss is sometimes mitigated by the excitement of discovery. You fear for him, and also root for him, and mostly you are captivated by his story and the sophisticated simplicity of its telling. What happens in the second part of the movie is a little more complicated. Saroo (now played by Dev Patel) has grown to manhood as the adopted son of an Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). He has a brother, Mantosh (Divian Ladwa) who was also adopted from India and has mental health and   problems. Despite that, Saroo seems to be living in the    stage of the fairy tale. He moves to Melbourne to study hotel management and falls in love with a fellow student, Lucy (Rooney Mara) from America. But memories of his   life haunt him, and the arrival of new technology raises the tantalizing possibility of a return to his first home. Using Google Earth, Saroo sets out to retrace, on the computer screen and on sheets of paper tacked to his bedroom wall, his accidental journey. It’s not a fast or easy process, and the effort takes an emotional toll on him, on his parents and on Lucy. But you know, even if you’re not familiar with the true story behind “Lion,” that the fairy tale will come true. Mr. Davis, with strong assistance from a cast of dignified, charismatic criers and the music of Hauschka and Dustin O’Halloran, floods the viewer with big feelings. If you have ever been a child, raised a child, lost a child or met a child  —   or a mother  —   this movie will wreck you. As a purely emotional experience it succeeds without feeling too manipulative or maudlin. I mean, it is manipulative and maudlin, but in a way that seems fair and transparent. Still, it isn’t quite satisfying. The transition from the young to the   Saroo demands a shift in tone and genre that “Lion” doesn’t quite achieve. What felt in the first part like wonderful, Spielbergian simplicity feels, in the latter sections, like simplification. There isn’t enough of the rough texture of family life or the complications of young love to give the older Saroo a full identity. The movie hovers on the edge of going deeper into his psychological predicament but holds itself back. At the end, the focus shifts from the agonies of Saroo to the glories of Google. I can’t complain too much about that for all I know, Google brought you to this review. But I also can’t help feeling a dystopian chill amid all the warm don’   fuzzies, a hint of corporate propaganda behind the fable. It is indeed remarkable how small the world has become, how many problems data can solve, how connected we all are to one another. But we’ve lost something, too, and we can’t even see what it is. “Lion” is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned) for sex and profanity.

4957,22789,Review: ‘Rogue One’ Leaves ‘Star Wars’ Fans Wanting More and Less - The New York Times,New York Times,A. O. Scott,12/17/2016,2016,12,,"The great mystery of “Rogue One”  —   the big payoff, the thing people like me would be pilloried for divulging, the puzzle you will congratulate yourself for solving  —   is where it fits in with the rest of the “Star Wars” cycle. There are scattered hints early on, and later appearances by familiar characters that elicit chuckles of recognition from fans. The very last shot tells us exactly where we are, and why we should have cared about everything we just saw. Whether that is enough  —   whether the fractures in the Rebel Alliance and the power struggles in the imperial ranks quicken our pulses and engage our emotions  —   is the big question, but it really isn’t a question at all. Millions of people will sit through this thoroughly mediocre movie (directed with basic competence by Gareth Edwards from a surprisingly hackish script by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy) and convince themselves that it’s perfectly delightful. It’s so much easier to obey than to resist. The spoiler warning sent by the Disney empire instructed journalists to “continue to be our partners on this journey,” and defiance is unthinkable, even if “partner” is taken as a synonym for “shill. ” But the injunction not to ruin anyone’s good time by “revealing spoilers and detailed story points” is itself revealing, an indication of the meager and disposable pleasures this movie is meant to provide, and also of the low regard its makers have for the audience. It hasn’t always been this way, of course. The first “Star Wars” trilogy had a fresh, insurgent energy, and learning the names of all those planets and galactic adventurers has seemed, to generations of fans, like a new and special kind of fun. Now, though, it is starting to feel like drudgery, a schoolbook exercise in a course of study that has no useful application and that will never end. “Rogue One,” named for the call sign of an imperial cargo ship appropriated by rebel fighters, is the opposite of that vessel. Masquerading as a heroic tale of rebellion, its true spirit is Empire all the way down. Like the fighters on the planet Scarif, which is surrounded by an    atmospheric shield, you are trapped inside this world, subjected to its whims and laws. You can’t escape, because it is the supposed desire to escape that brought you here in the first place. Maybe I’m exaggerating. The cast is wonderful. Felicity Jones is a fine addition to the “Star Wars” tradition of     heroines. She plays Jyn Erso, the daughter of Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) a scientist whose allegiances are a little ambiguous. Not at all ambiguous is Ben Mendelsohn’s Orson Krennic, a marvel of sneering, vainglorious villainy in an impeccable white uniform, complete with a cape that billows behind him when he strides down a starship catwalk. Jyn’s idealistic   tendencies are at first checked by a hint of   cynicism. She’s suspicious of the rebels and contemptuous of the Empire, and has complicated feelings about Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) the extremist militant who cared for her in her father’s absence. When a mission announces itself  —   I don’t think I’m supposed to say too much about it, other than that it’s highly perilous and requires a lot of   and aerial battling  —   Jyn gathers up an appealing, motley guerrilla crew. There’s a renegade imperial pilot (Riz Ahmed) a   resistance type (Diego Luna) a blind monk (Donnie Yen) and a bearded berserker (Wen Jiang). And naturally, a wisecracking droid, speaking in the dry, sarcastic tones of the indispensable Alan Tudyk. All the pieces are there, in other words, like Lego figures in a box. The problem is that the filmmakers haven’t really bothered to think of anything very interesting to do with them. A couple of    on a   rainy afternoon would come up with better adventures, and probably also better dialogue. Plots and subplots are handled with clumsy expediency, and themes that might connect this movie with the larger Lucasfilm mythos aren’t allowed to develop. You’re left wanting both more and less. There are too many characters, too much tactical and technical explanation, too much   prattle. And at the same time, there isn’t quite enough of the filial dynamic between Galen and Jyn, and not enough weight given to the ethical and strategic problems of rebellion. When might ends justify means? What kind of sacrifice is required in the service of a righteous cause? Popular art  —   “Star Wars” included  —   has often proved itself capable of exploring these kinds of questions with clarity, vigor and even a measure of nuance. But “Rogue One” has no such ambitions, no will to persuade the audience of anything other than the continued strength of the brand. It doesn’t so much preach to the choir as propagandize to the captives, telling us that we’re free spirits and partners on the journey. The only force at work here is the force of habit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5458,23379,Review: Matthew McConaughey Rebels Against Rebels in ‘Free State of Jones’ - The New York Times,New York Times,A. O. Scott,6/24/2016,2016,6,,"“Free State of Jones” begins on the battlefield, with a flurry of the kind of immersive combat action that has long been a staple of American movies. The setting is familiar in other ways, too. As a line of Confederate troops marches across a field into Union rifle and artillery fire, a haze of myth starts to gather over the action, a mist of sentiment about the tragedy of the Civil War and the symmetrical valor of the soldiers on both sides of it. But this is a sly piece of misdirection: The rest of the movie will be devoted to blowing that fog away, using the tools of Hollywood spectacle to restore a measure of clarity to our understanding of the war and its aftermath. Directed by Gary Ross (“Seabiscuit”) with blunt authority and unusual respect for historical truth, “Free State of Jones” explores a neglected and fascinating chapter in American history. Mr. Ross consulted some of the leading experts in the era  —   including Eric Foner of Columbia University, whose “Reconstruction” is the definitive study, and Martha Hodes of New York University, author of a prizewinning study of interracial sexuality in the   South  —   and has done a good job of balancing the factual record with the demands of dramatic storytelling. The result is a riveting visual history lesson, whose occasional didacticism is integral to its power. The hero of this tale is Newton Knight, a poor farmer from Jones County, Miss. who led a guerrilla army of white deserters and escaped slaves against the Confederacy during the war. Afterward, he tried to hold this coalition together as a political force in the face of Ku Klux Klan terror. As played by Matthew McConaughey, Newton is an ordinary man radicalized by circumstances. His hollow cheeks and wild whiskers suggest a zealous temperament, but the kindness in his eyes conveys the decency and compassion that lie at the heart of his moral commitment. Mr. McConaughey is too rugged and ragged to sink into saintliness, which is one reason that his righteous characters  —   including Ron Woodroof in “Dallas Buyers Club” and Mick Haller in “The Lincoln Lawyer”  —   are sometimes more fun than the movies they inhabit. And while Mr. Ross’s story makes Newton unambiguously heroic, this is not yet another film about a white savior sacrificing himself on behalf of the   oppressed. Nor for that matter is it the story of a white sinner redeemed by the superhuman selflessness of black people. “Free State of Jones” is a rarer thing: a film that tries to strike sparks of political insight from a   genre template. It’s a western of sorts, and a romantic rebel movie of sorts  —   there are hints of “Viva Zapata!” and “Shane” and a   other underdog classics  —   but with an unusually clear ideological focus. After fleeing the army, where he had served as a battlefield nurse, and witnessing Confederate authorities confiscating his neighbors’ livestock and grain, Newton takes refuge in a swamp with a small group of slaves who have run away from a nearby plantation, including a man named Moses (Mahershala Ali) who becomes his friend and confidant. Through his conversations with Moses and with Rachel (Gugu  ) a domestic slave who brings the fugitives news and supplies from the plantation house, Newton comes to believe that the slaves share a common enemy and a common interest with poor white farmers like himself. “Free State of Jones” is careful not to suggest that the conditions endured by disenfranchised white and enslaved black Mississippians were identical. The system may be rigged against both, but in different ways. Especially after the war, the alliance proves fragile, as white supremacy reasserts itself with renewed brutality. Its persistence is emphasized by a subplot that takes place 85 years after the war in a Mississippi courtroom, where Davis Knight (Brian Lee Franklin) a descendant of Newton’s, is on trial for breaking the state’s law against interracial marriage. The question of Davis’s racial identity turns on whether he is descended from Rachel or Serena (Keri Russell) Newton’s wife at the beginning of the movie. The romance between a white man and an enslaved black woman is, to say the least, a delicate issue for a movie like this to deal with, but Mr. Ross handles this and other fraught matters with impressive tact and sensitivity. The film does not minimize the violence of slavery, including the sexual violence that was the daily experience of women like Rachel, but it also refrains from turning cruelty into spectacle. Mr. Ross has an   faith in the power of editing, and in the ability of the audience to imagine what he refrains from showing explicitly. Which is not to say that “Free State of Jones” is a subtle movie. Why should it be? There is nothing wrong with a story that has clear heroes and villains, especially when such roles have been misconceived for so long. The wily and charismatic Newton Knight is a revisionist archetype, a white Southern rebel fighting against the mythology that such figures usually embody. He takes down the Stars and Bars and raises Old Glory above his territory this movie holds no truck with   nonsense about a genteel Southern way of life menaced by Yankee aggression. It is obvious to Newton, and certainly to Moses, that the Glorious Cause of the Confederacy was a rapacious and exploitative   capitalist economy, and that the resistance to Reconstruction was intended to restore that system. This view reflects the current scholarly consensus, but much of American popular culture, like much of American politics, remains besotted by the old mythology. Freedom is a long struggle. “Free State of Jones” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Gory wartime violence and less explicit but equally upsetting postwar brutality. Running time: 2 hours 19 minutes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5614,23593,"Review: In ‘Jason Bourne,’ a Midlife Crisis for a Harried Former Assassin - The New York Times",New York Times,A. O. Scott,7/29/2016,2016,7,,"Jason Bourne, taciturn and   hurries through various European capitals  —   Rome, Athens, London  —   with the grim determination of a tourist who desperately needs a men’s room but is too proud to ask for directions. Really, of course, he’s being followed and watched, at street level and from a   surveillance hub on the other side of the ocean, where his erstwhile employers in the C. I. A. track him as if he were the quarry in a   game of Pokémon Go. Like Jigglypuff or Snorlax, Bourne is a     throwback brought back into circulation because   …    well, why not? It’s summer. People need something to do, and at the moment, two hours of   paranoia might provide a soothing respite from the real thing. The good news and the bad news is that “Jason Bourne,” directed by Paul Greengrass and starring Matt Damon as everyone’s favorite amnesiac assassin, feels like old times. The band is back together for a reunion tour, and if some of the original members are missing, the new additions have learned the chords and are even permitted to try out a few fresh riffs. Almost a decade has passed since the last time Mr. Greengrass and Mr. Damon stepped out in this franchise together, and their return is both welcome and weary. In 2004, when Mr. Greengrass took over the series with “The Bourne Supremacy” (Doug Liman had directed “The Bourne Identity” two years before) his approach to action filmmaking felt distinctive and new. Now, his vigorous, rigorous style of shooting and editing  —   maximum speed and maximum chaos rendered with elegant, sometimes breathtaking coherence  —   has kind of an     vibe. The thrill isn’t entirely gone. It’s just a little more subdued. Mr. Damon, for his part, is as subdued as ever. Jason Bourne is a uniquely passive action hero, a man who runs on pure survival instinct as he tries to figure out who is after him and why. After so many years and so much running, his existential predicament has become a matter of routine. He knows that he knows some bad stuff  —   and his pursuers know it, too  —   but he’s not entirely sure what he knows or how he knows it. For him, the resulting confusion is harrowing. For us, it’s part of the fun, like the insidery frisson of hearing nuggets of spy jargon hissed by unsmiling people in dark suits. “Alpha team, I need a sitrep, stat!” The sitrep here is that Bourne, who has been pursuing his Plan B career as a   boxer in the wilds of Greece, is approached by his former colleague and fellow Company renegade, Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles). She has some information, harvested from a hacker camp in Iceland, concerning past Agency skulduggery involving Bourne’s father (Gregg Henry, in flashbacks). Nicky and Jason rendezvous in Athens in the middle of a riot, and the   chase commences, with Robert Dewey, the director of the C. I. A. (Tommy Lee Jones) and Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) one of his ambitious underlings, running the show amid the satellite feeds and data displays of suburban Virginia. Their main operational weapon on the ground overseas is a killer known only as the Asset (Vincent Cassel) who harbors a personal grudge against Bourne. This is perhaps the most striking feature of “Jason Bourne”: Virtually all the major characters  —   good, bad and    —   work for the same organization, at least on a consulting basis. There are dark whispers about external threats, and invocations of the tension between security and privacy in the digital age, but geopolitics and technology are scaffolding for what is essentially a movie about human resources challenges in a large bureaucracy. This chapter in the series, coming after the emergence of WikiLeaks and the growth of social media, takes passing note of contemporary realities. Edward J. Snowden’s name is dropped a few times, and there is a subplot about a young tech mogul named Aaron Kalloor (Riz Ahmed) who is trying to extricate his company from Dewey’s pocket. Terrorism and surveillance are treated both as facts of life and as vaporous abstractions. When Dewey talks about protecting the homeland, or Kalloor speaks of the importance of protecting consumer data, the words carry no real conviction, on the part of either the characters or the filmmakers. There is also a rote quality to much of the action, an absence of passion, if not of skill. I suspect that some youngsters out there will complain that “Jason Bourne” is tedious and irrelevant. Without disputing the substance of that judgment, I can’t help taking it personally. The tedium, I would argue, is not incidental but essential, because this is not really a spy thriller or even a   and    action movie, but rather a somber meditation on the crisis of the   professional in the throes of middle age. I’m not casting shade on Mr. Damon, who at 45 looks terrific, with the complete opposite of a dad bod and a residual Will Hunting twinkle in his eye. But reflect for a moment on the character he plays, who must do his own   on the fly and under duress. Jason, for all his prodigious talent and carefully honed technique, finds himself permanently stalled on the career ladder, unable either to advance or to quit. To make matters worse, he is caught in a generational pincers grip, squeezed on one side by a   and sentimental   boss (Mr. Jones) and on the other by a   millennial rising quickly through the ranks (Ms. Vikander). Poor Bourne is burdened with inconvenient historical knowledge even as he must fight a perpetual battle against his own obsolescence. So I have to say I’m rooting for the guy. I doubt he’ll ever truly figure out who he is. But at least he can keep moving until his 401( k) is fully vested, and he can finally get around to writing that novel. “Jason Bourne” is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned). A modest body count by the standards of the genre.

5846,23920,Cinema Is Dead? Telluride Says Not Yet - The New York Times,New York Times,A. O. Scott,9/6/2016,2016,9,,"TELLURIDE, Colo.  —   Can we please kill the talk about the death of movies? Yes, it was a dreary summer. The box office was weak and the big Hollywood releases were weaker. Critics were grumpy. Audiences seemed indifferent. There was so much good television. And so the band struck up the funeral march, as it does every year, and the obituaries circulated on social media. Cinema is dead. (Again.) The donning of sackcloth and ashes for this   art form is an annual ritual. But so is the Telluride Film Festival, which functions partly as a standing rebuke to such fatalism and gloom. The beauty of the mountain setting and this elegant former mining town’s distance from the stresses of New York, Los Angeles and Toronto have a way of dispelling pessimism. More consequentially, the festival here is a gathering of the faithful, consecrated to the   cinephile religion. The local school gym and a hockey rink on the edge of town are temporarily converted into what screening M. C.’s unironically refer to as cathedrals of cinema. Everyone is a believer. Telluride began in the   largely as a place to show old, rare and restored films, a commitment that survives in a robust program of classics and curiosities presented by prominent guest directors. And it seduces audiences with the promise that the future of film  —   the art if not the photochemical medium  —   will be as glorious as the past. Maybe this is mythmaking or wishful thinking, but having spent a few days here in the dark I prefer to regard it as hardheaded realism. Whatever the state of the industry or the prevailing winds in the culture and the digital economy, the integrity and specificity of cinema is a fact. And its vital signs are strong. Damien Chazelle’s “La La Land” is both an example of and an argument for the uniqueness of movies. A lavish and lovely musical romance, it is set in a Los Angeles populated by   creative strivers. Two of these, a jazz pianist named Seb (Ryan Gosling) and a thesp (as the trades would say) named Mia (Emma Stone) meet cute in a gigantic traffic jam that doubles as a    extravaganza. The next two hours follow the entwined, contrapuntal progress of their relationship and their careers, punctuated by more songs and ending in a swirl of piercing and complex emotion. “La La Land” is simultaneously a   throwback and a   gamble. Mr. Chazelle, whose previous features were “Whiplash” and “Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench,” affectionately nods at the tradition of movie musicals, invoking the MGM Technicolor gems of the ’50s and Jacques Demy’s “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. ” But even though his Los Angeles has a decidedly retro vibe, there is something more than nostalgia at work here. At 31, Mr. Chazelle doesn’t just want to summon the old magic. He also wants to modernize it. The tantalizing question is whether, after the hosannas from critics here and at the Venice Film Festival, modern, millennial audiences will allow themselves to fall under the spell. My hunch is they will: The mixture of antiquarian precision and entrepreneurial   that drives “La La Land” will be embraced by a generation for whom preservation and invention often go together. It will, in any case, reward literal moviegoers, those hardy souls willing to switch off the flat screen, silence the cellphone and sit quietly in a roomful of strangers. Cinema is an art form, but it is also a destination, a reason to get out of the house. From the viewer’s perspective, a movie is a nondomestic, nonserial experience, enclosed in time and space and, ideally, lingering in the mind after the lights go on and you stumble out into the world. Your perception is at least momentarily altered. A film festival is a collection of such experiences, an archipelago of   worlds. You could drift from “La La Land” to Denis Villeneuve’s “Arrival,” an eerie and emotional   movie that similarly evokes and updates the grandeur and mystery of past   masterpieces. It shares some DNA with “2001” and “Solaris,” and stars Amy Adams as a linguist wrestling with grief and an imposing research assignment. Twelve   black spaceships are hovering over Earth, and she must use her professional skills to figure out what their   inhabitants want. “Arrival” is an elegant puzzle, an engrossing exercise in    —   for the protagonist, the filmmaker and the viewer alike. Mr. Villeneuve, assisted by Bradford Young’s haunting cinematography and Johann Johannsson’s menacing, melancholy score, creates a heady, sensual atmosphere in which the boundaries between thinking and feeling are artfully blurred. Which may just be another way of repeating that it’s a movie, rather than a franchise installment or a piece of   digital entertainment. Maybe that sounds overly defensive. It’s hard, watching four or five films a day amid crowds of fellow pilgrims, to believe that you’re participating in something marginal, obsolescent or beleaguered. There are too many revelations, large and small. There is the exquisite lyricism and deep feeling of “Moonlight,” Barry Jenkins’s astonishing second feature, about a young black man’s coming of age in three piercing chapters. The film cracks open stereotypes and wears its empathy and its artistry on its sleeve. There is the prickly wit and delicious complication of “Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer,” Joseph Cedar’s ebullient   comedy, with Richard Gere in the title role. There is the philosophical mischief of “Into the Inferno,” the latest documentary adventure from Werner Herzog, which follows him to the edges of volcanoes in search of cosmic meaning and human peculiarity. And then there are treasures in transit from Sundance, Berlin and Cannes, arriving on vapor trails of enthusiasm. Among these are Cristian Mungiu’s “Graduation,” Kenneth Lonergan’s “Manchester by the Sea,” Mia  ’s “Things to Come” and, above all, Maren Ade’s “Toni Erdmann. ” Each one in its own way constitutes proof of life for movies. All of them, curiously, dwell at least partly on the complexities of parenthood. “Manchester” is a lacerating, but also frequently funny, study of the long aftermath of grief, with Casey Affleck as a man damaged by past trauma trying to help his nephew (Lucas Hedges). “Graduation” is about a Romanian doctor’s ethical struggles as he tries to help his daughter find a better future by studying abroad. “Things to Come” is a quiet midlife drama in which a philosophy professor (Isabelle Huppert) navigates disruptions in her family and her inner life. “Toni Erdmann,” though. If a single movie were enough to silence reports of the death of cinema, it would be this one, an    German comedy set mostly in Bucharest. It you think that sounds preposterous, you’re not wrong. I hesitate to offer further description, since any attempt to characterize this film in conventional terms  —   as a   story, a feminist satire of corporate behavior, a fable of global capitalism, an extended practical joke  —   would be woefully insufficient. It’s something new under the sun, a thrilling and discomfiting document of the present moment and also, like every movie that matters, a bulletin from the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6214,24408,Review: ‘Manchester by the Sea’ and the Tides of Grief - The New York Times,New York Times,A. O. Scott,4/19/2017,2017,4,,"In each of the three movies Kenneth Lonergan has directed, characters move through their everyday lives under the shadow of death. The brother and sister played by Mark Ruffalo and Laura Linney in “You Can Count on Me” (2000) had, when they were children, lost their parents in a car crash, a trauma that rippled unspoken beneath their mundane adult interactions. The    of Lisa Cohen, the New York teenager (Anna Paquin) at the center of “Margaret” (2011) was complicated by a fatal bus accident and colored by the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Early in Mr. Lonergan’s new film, “Manchester by the Sea,” Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is summoned back to his hometown by news that his older brother, Joe, has died. Joe, an affable bear of a man (Kyle Chandler, in flashbacks) had had congestive heart failure for a long time, so his death, while wrenching and sad, could not have been entirely unexpected. What Joe’s    son, Patrick (Lucas Hedges) and Lee face together might fall under the heading of ordinary grief: tragic to be sure, but manageable. Lee, though, already lives with a much more extreme kind of pain. You can see it in his smallest gestures and hear it in his flat, careful diction. The force of his   emotion is terrifying, and so is the   he must exercise to keep it invisible. Mr. Affleck, in one of the most fiercely disciplined screen performances in recent memory, conveys both Lee’s inner avalanche of feeling and the numb decorum that holds it back. The source of his anguish is revealed about halfway through the film, which almost buckles, like Lee himself, under the weight of unimaginable horror. How could anyone deal with such a disaster? How do you live with yourself afterward? Mr. Lonergan poses these questions not in the abstract, but as practical matters. Much of the action in “Manchester by the Sea” consists of dumb routines and petty disruptions, the kind of stuff that keeps happening even in the wake of enormous changes and dramatic upheavals. Before he learns of Joe’s death, Lee, who works as a janitor in a handful of apartment buildings near Boston, shovels snow, takes out the garbage and tackles plumbing problems. Once he returns home to look after Patrick, whose mother (Gretchen Mol) is out of the picture, things become a little more unpredictable. Lee has to meet with lawyers and funeral directors. He drives his nephew to band practice and heats up leftover pizza in the microwave. He forgets where he parked the car. He has to figure out what to do about Joe’s commercial fishing boat and what to say about Patrick’s complicated romantic situation. A lot happens, and a surprising amount of it is very funny. Mr. Lonergan, a brilliant playwright and a   script doctor, is a master of the quotidian absurd. In his work, the laws of the universe are rigged to make human beings look ridiculous, and the species is internally wired to produce the same effect, so no amount of good taste or moral discipline can stop the jokes from coming. In Lee’s earlier life, when he lived with his wife, Randi (Michelle Williams) and their three children, he was a joker, the mischievous, wisecracking life of his own roving party. Even in his stunned, spiritually crippled later condition, the habits of sarcasm and   stick with him like   sensations. Joy may be out of reach, but he can’t help but find shards of humor wherever he looks. This trait clearly runs in the family. Lee and his nephew, thrown together by bereavement, have the makings of a comedy team. “What happened to your hand?” Patrick asks Lee, noticing bandages and blood. “I cut it. ” “Oh, thanks. For a minute there I didn’t know what happened. ” They’ve got a million of them. But Mr. Lonergan isn’t trafficking in bittersweet sitcom beats. He’s after a kind of realism rarely found in recent American movies, which often seem to think that audiences will be confused or offended when the silly and the serious collide onscreen. “Manchester by the Sea” is a finely shaded portrait, a study in individual misery set in a place that is observed with care and affection. Mr. Affleck and Mr. Hedges are exceptional, but the rest of the large cast is nearly as fine. (I’d single out Ms. Williams, Ms. Mol and C. J. Wilson, who plays Joe’s best pal and business partner.) The coastal Massachusetts town that gives the movie its name is picturesque in a modest, thrifty New England way. Not breathtaking, but calm and orderly, its hills flecked with tall deciduous trees and clapboard houses, its harbor ringed with   rocky islands. In the opening scene  —   a memory of Lee, Patrick and Joe out on the boat under a bright blue sky, teasing and roughhousing and trying to catch a fish  —   it’s heaven. Later it feels like purgatory, a wintry place with flat skies, leaden waters and unwelcome reminders of the past. (The cinematographer who deftly captures this rough beauty is Jody Lee Lipes.) But “Manchester by the Sea” is not only about Lee and his family, and not only about their houses and boats and drinking habits and marriages. It is also about what all those things mean, and what kinds of sentimental and ideological value are attached to them. The movie takes up, indirectly and perhaps inadvertently but powerfully and unmistakably, a subject that has lately reinserted itself dramatically into American political discourse. It’s a movie, that is, about the sorrows of white men. I’m not being dismissive. I’m being specific. Mr. Lonergan is too astute about the textures of American life to assume that the racial and class identities of his characters are incidental or without larger significance. That was true of the rich New York kids in Mr. Lonergan’s play “This Is Our Youth,” from 1996, and it’s no less true of the   citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts here, even if they are too diffident or too busy for sociological  . In   American cinema  —   from “Mystic River” to “Gone Baby Gone,” from “The Fighter” to “The Departed”  —   the Bay State is where the myths of     white identity have been forged. Nonwhite characters are as scarce as fully articulated r’s, and the uncomfortable racial history that has existed in reality (the Boston busing battles of the 1970s, for instance) is easily ignored. There is no legacy of slavery or Jim Crow, and therefore an aura of innocence can be maintained amid the dysfunction and sentimentality and clannishness. “Manchester by the Sea,” partly because it is a product of the   industrial complex, partakes of some of this   but it also resists the more tiresome clichés of the   Boston movie. (There are moments when the exploitation of the local accent verges on parody. Why else write an extended argument over the merits of “  Trek” or a series of jokes about   ?) Mr. Lonergan is more interested in guilt than in criminality, and less concerned with nostalgia than with the psychology of loss. This is not a   of redemption or revenge, with boxers and gangsters and their churchgoing moms and wives. It’s a masculine melodrama that doubles as a fable of social catastrophe. Lee, Joe and their friends would never define themselves as privileged. They have proletarian tastes and sensibilities. But they also have   houses and boats, kids on track for college, decent medical care and an ironclad entitlement to the benefit of the doubt. (Observe what happens to Lee in the Manchester police station and you’ll see what I mean.) Their main problems come from women, who spoil the parties, don’t get the jokes and sometimes can’t control their drinking or keep their pants on. Some are good moms or good sports, and anyway, a man can always steal away to the boat or the basement with the guys and some beers. Cast out of this working man’s paradise, Lee is also exiled from the prerogatives of whiteness. He lives in a basement room, earning minimum wage, answering to an   boss and accepting a tip from a black tenant whose toilet he has cleaned and repaired. He doesn’t complain, but it is also clear that he has chosen these conditions as a form of   as punishment for his sins. Maybe its sounds like I’m   or making an accusation. But to deny that “Manchester by the Sea” has a racial dimension is to underestimate its honesty and overlook its difficult relevance. Lee is guilty and angry,   that what happened was not his fault and   that it was, unable to apologize or to accept apologies, paralyzed by grief and stung by a sense of grievance. He’s broken, and he’s also smart enough to realize  —   and Mr. Lonergan is wise and generous enough to allow him to understand  —   that nothing will make him whole again. “Manchester by the Sea” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for characters who curse fate and one another.

6681,25019,"Review: ‘The Secret Life of Pets’ Amuses, but Misses Opportunities - The New York Times",New York Times,A. O. Scott,7/8/2016,2016,7,,"First things first: “The Secret Life of Pets” is preceded by a short film starring the Minions, in which those irrepressible yellow gelcaps take up landscaping so they can purchase a blender. You may regard this extra little cartoon as a bonus or a tax, depending on your level of Minion tolerance. Mine reached its end around 90 seconds before the movie did. But in any case, Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures are determined to keep selling toys and Halloween costumes, and it’s pointless to protest the merchandising of manufactured cuteness. Part of the Minions’ ostensibly universal charm lies in the fact that they speak no known language, but rather a chirpy, vaguely   patois. “The Secret Life of Pets,” Illumination’s newest feature, relies on the more conventional sound of celebrity voices, mostly belonging to people who are professionally funny on television. Children may not be all that familiar with many of them, including Louis C. K. who plays the main character, a dog named Max. Louis C. K. on his television projects and in his   tends to work on the blue end of the spectrum, trafficking in melancholy as well as profanity. His presence here may be a gift to his own children, and to their college funds. It might also provide a measure of consolation to gloomy, sensitive   dads who need to sense a kindred soul on the other side of the screen. Similarly, Hannibal Buress (a dachshund) Jenny Slate (a fuzzy white lap dog whose exact breed I could not identify) and Lake Bell (a cat) might be here not because kids will recognize them from “Broad City” or “Obvious Child” or “In a World” but because youngish parents might want to feel a little bit cool at the multiplex on a Saturday afternoon. No shame in that! Fans of “Modern Family” will be happy to hear Eric Stonestreet as a big furry dog. Fans of Kevin Hart who want more after “Central Intelligence” and “Ride Along 2” will enjoy his impersonation of an angry bunny. Albert Brooks is a grumpy raptor. That sentence was a pleasure to write. There is also a guinea pig, some other birds, lizards and even a few human beings. But this is mostly a dog story, full of capers and complications arising from the arrival of Duke (the big shaggy one voiced by Mr. Stonestreet) into the household Max shares with Katie (Ellie Kemper) his millennial owner. There is rivalry and resentment and eventually friendship. “The Secret Life of Pets,” written by Cinco Paul, Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch and directed by Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud, is like one of those picture books about how to deal with a new baby, but with talking animals. Which is, all in all, pretty good fun.   cartoons generally are, if they have even a modest quantity of wit or   insight. And while this movie never achieves  —   and does not really aim for  —   the emotional richness or visual inventiveness of the better Pixar features, or the sly social consciousness of “Zootopia,” it has a playful absurdity and a winning, friendly spirit. As the title suggests, the conceit is that when we humans are away, our furry, scaly, feathered companions get up to all kinds of mischief. They visit one another’s apartments, they dance and flirt and play loud music and then, when we return, pretend that they’ve been waiting for us the whole time. Except for the cats, of course, who make a great show of not caring. Here I should say that, while Ms. Bell’s purring vocalizations are beyond reproach, the film is clearly the work of dog people, and traffics  —   like nearly every other movie in its genre  —   in some tired   stereotypes. I could go on about this, but I’m not supposed to let my political opinions affect my reviews. And I’m not biased. Dogs are fine. I have shared my home and opened my heart to a few of them. But they’re also just too easy, with their wet noses and broad pink tongues and eagerness to please. Cats are demanding. Complex. A more daring movie would have ventured beyond fat, pampered house cats and scrawny alley predators in its depiction of them. Representation matters. Speaking of politics, the house pets encounter an underground militant organization led by Mr. Hart’s adorably fuzzy, implacable little rabbit. He steals the movie, of course, and helps it ascend to a level of anarchic delight. The animated action is bouncy and frenetic, and if the story becomes a little too busy, it moves quickly and makes room for a barrage of jokes and even some character development. Ms. Slate’s Gidget the lap dog evolves from a lovestruck princess (pining for Max) into a fierce and resourceful action heroine. Max himself grows less  . Everyone gets home safely. Like the “Despicable Me” movies, which put Illumination on the map (and spawned those furshlugginer Minions) “The Secret Life of Pets” is adequate animated entertainment, amusing while it lasts but not especially memorable except as a catalog of compromises and missed opportunities. Among those are the New York setting, a potential wonderland of glamour, filth and imagination that is rendered as blandly as if the movie had been shot on a   set. “The Secret Life of Pets” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Fewer poop jokes than you might expect.

7241,25781,"Review: In ‘Finding Dory,’ a Forgetful Fish and a Warm Celebration of Differences - The New York Times",New York Times,A. O. Scott,6/22/2016,2016,6,,"In “Finding Nemo,” Pixar’s 2003 masterpiece, the ocean was a vast realm of menace and wonder, newly charted by rapidly advancing   technology. The movie, a visual revelation, was also a welcome defense of   in an era of anxiety, and something of a cautionary tale about the downsides of helicopter parenting. As often happens in adventure stories, the hero was occasionally upstaged by his sidekick. We rooted for Nemo and choked up when he was found, but the best lines and sweetest grace notes belonged to Dory, the   blue tang voiced by Ellen DeGeneres. Now Dory has her own movie, imaginatively called “Finding Dory,” a merchandising opportunity for Disney and a welcome      diversion for parents and children. While it may not join the top tier of Pixar features, “Dory,” directed by Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane, is certainly the best  “Toy Story” sequel the studio has produced. That may sound like faint praise given the startling mediocrity of “Monsters University” and “Cars 2,” but what “Dory” lacks in dazzling originality it more than makes up for in warmth, charm and good humor. (Meanwhile, Pixar’s place on the vanguard of animation is affirmed by “Piper,” the short, directed by Alan Barillaro, that accompanies “Finding Dory” in theaters. A variation on the themes of “Nemo,” it tells the simple, touching story of a fledgling shore bird overcoming fear and facing danger. It also makes astonishing strides in the vivid and detailed rendering of feathers, foam and sand.) Taking place, for the most part, a year after Nemo’s return to the reef, “Finding Dory” flashes back to its heroine’s childhood, when she was an adorable, popeyed,     hatchling living with her mom (Diane Keaton) and dad (Eugene Levy). She wandered off one day, and grew to adulthood looking for her family. The revival of this quest sends her across the seas, and this time Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Nemo (Hayden Rolence) are the sidekicks. Not the only ones. Like other films of its species, “Finding Dory” is full of celebrity voice work, including from a number of television performers. Kaitlin Olson of “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” is a nearsighted shark. Idris Elba and Dominic West have a “Wire” reunion  —   Stringer Bell and McNulty,  together again!  —   as a pair of Cockney sea lions. Ty Burrell plays a nervous beluga whale, while his “Modern Family”    Ed O’Neill, steals many scenes as a wily, grouchy,   octopus named Hank. Instead of the open seas, Dory conducts her search mostly in the confines of the Marine Life Institute, an institution clearly inspired by the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California that the filmmakers turn into a theme park full of mechanical ingenuity and aquatic cuteness. There are toys and tots, aquarium tanks and drain pipes, strange birds and the disembodied voice of Sigourney Weaver. The plot, like a   ride, is both predictable and exciting, a   cascade of triumphs and setbacks, punctuated with humor and pathos. But in   tradition, the movie also has lessons to impart. “Nemo” made the case for indomitability in the face of fear. “Dory” is more about the acceptance of chaos. Dory’s inability to make or stick to plans is shown, in the long run, to be an advantage. And her memory issues, played mostly for laughs in the first movie, take on a deeper meaning here. She and Nemo, who was born with a deformed flipper, are both people  —   well, actually, anthropomorphized fish, but you know what I mean  —   with disabilities, an identity shared by most of the new secondary characters. In a way that is both emphatic and subtle, “Finding Dory” is a celebration of cognitive and physical differences. It argues, with lovely ingenuity and understatement, that what appear to be impairments might better be understood as strengths. The inclusiveness of the film’s vision is remarkable partly because it feels so natural, something that no adult will really need to explain. Children will get it, perhaps more intuitively and easily than the rest of us. Everyone will laugh at the sight of an octopus driving a truck, a   loon flying with a bucket of angelfish in her beak and the other slapstick set pieces. And very few throats will remain unlumped as   characters are reunited. Maybe there are a few too many reunions. How many times does Dory need to be found? But the repetitiveness of the story is related to its moral, a Disney legacy reanimated by Pixar again and again. Solidarity and kinship are two sides of the same coin. “Friends and family” is a distinction without a difference. “Finding Dory” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A little scary, a little sad.

7284,25834,Review: ‘Café Society’ Isn’t Woody Allen’s Worst Movie - The New York Times,New York Times,A. O. Scott,7/15/2016,2016,7,,"“Café Society,” Woody Allen’s new movie, comes wrapped in a double layer of nostalgia. Set in the 1930s, partly in Los Angeles, its script compulsively mentions Hollywood stars of the era. Joan Blondell! Robert Taylor! Barbara Stanwyck! Cagney and Crawford! Astaire and Rogers! Their names ring out like answers to trivia questions nobody had thought to ask. At a recent New York critics’ screening, one fellow a few rows behind me chuckled at every name. I don’t think because the allusions were especially funny  —   the sentence “Adolphe Menjou is threatening to walk off the set” is not exactly a   even in context  —   but because they signified a cultural awareness that the laugher in the dark wanted the rest of us to know he shared. And also perhaps because the dropped names stood in for jokes that the modern audience is too ignorant to get and that Mr. Allen has grown too lazy to make. He can gaze back fondly at the   golden age of   popular culture, and the rest of us can wistfully recall a time when he was able to spin those memories into better films than this one. There’s no point in growing  . “Café Society” is not “Radio Days” or “Bullets Over Broadway. ” We can live with that. I’m happy to report that it’s not “The Curse of the Jade Scorpion” or “Magic in the Moonlight,” either. Which is to say that it’s neither another example of bad, late Woody Allen nor much in the way of a return to form. It is, overall, an amusing little picture, with some inspired moments and some sour notes, a handful of interesting performances and the hint, now and then, of an idea. Like most of Mr. Allen’s recent work, this movie takes place within the hermetically enclosed universe of its maker’s   preoccupations. Rather than find fresh themes or problems, he likes to rearrange the old ones into a newish pattern, emphasizing some elements and letting others drift into the background. Here the dominant conceit is Mr. Allen’s   ambivalence about California and the industry that has often seemed ambivalent about him. He loves movies, but Hollywood, with its shallowness and gossip, has always repelled him. But with the help of his gifted collaborators, the production designer Santo Loquasto and the cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, he bathes “the film colony” in golden light and swathes its denizens in lovely period clothes. He sends an ambitious Bronx boy, Bobby Dorfman (Jesse Eisenberg) out West to seek his fortune. At first   by his Uncle Phil (Steve Carell) a powerful agent, Bobby is eventually taken under Phil’s wing and plunged into a swirl of parties and power lunches. He’s suitably intoxicated by his new surroundings. “I’ve never mixed Champagne with bagels and lox,” he says. “Welcome to Hollywood,” someone replies. That’s not a bad line, and there are some other pretty good ones sprinkled throughout the sprawling script. Bobby’s bickering parents, played by Jeannie Berlin and Ken Stott, supply a few   laughs, as well as the requisite touch of metaphysical fatalism. (“I accept death, but under protest,” Dad says. “Protest to who?” Mom responds. Also not a bad line.) The ensemble is larger and the story looser than in Mr. Allen’s last few movies, making room for Corey Stoll’s relaxed turn as Bobby’s charismatic gangster brother and Parker Posey and Paul Schneider’s intriguing double act as a cynical and apparently happily married pair of bicoastal sophisticates. The axis on which everything turns is an   love triangle that includes, of course, the passion of an older man for a younger woman. It turns out that Bobby and Phil are both in love with a transplanted Nebraskan called Vonnie (short for Veronica) who is Phil’s secretary. Kristen Stewart’s performance in the role, which blends gravity and lightness, glamour and its opposite, is certainly the best part of “Café Society,” but it also exposes just how thin and tired the rest of the movie is. Mr. Allen’s literal voice, which supplies narration, sounds unusually sluggish and weary. The same is true of his voice as a writer and director. For every snappy scene or exchange there are three or four that feel baggy and  . We are treated to one survey of the clientele at the swanky Manhattan nightclub that is Bobby’s   professional perch and then, a while later, to another. We wander into jazz clubs and dining rooms and seem unsure of why we’ve come. Blake Lively, wandering into the movie’s second half as a second Veronica, seems to feel the same way. The movie seems much longer than its 96 minutes. Every once in a while we hear or see something that makes us cringe a little: a harsh, unfunny encounter between Bobby and a prostitute shortly after his arrival in Los Angeles an anecdote about Errol Flynn’s sexual interest in underage girls. It’s hard to say if Mr. Allen is testing the audience’s tolerance or trolling our sensitivities, or for that matter if he’s just blithely carrying on as he always has, oblivious to changing mores or the vicissitudes of his own reputation. It doesn’t really matter because “Café Society” ultimately poses no interesting questions about its maker or its characters. The movie most closely resembles the kind of Hollywood product for which its deepest nostalgia is reserved. It’s a   throwaway, a charming bit of trivia, the punch line to a   joke. “Café Society” is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned). Surprisingly bloody murders and surprisingly bloodless romance. Running time: 1 hour 36 minutes.

7304,25866,"Review: In ‘Little Men,’ Boys Develop a Bond That Is Threatened by Money - The New York Times",New York Times,A. O. Scott,1/25/2017,2017,1,,"There is hardly a shortage of buddy movies about mismatched men bonding under duress, but films that chart the emotional weather of everyday male friendship are rare. Literature has more to offer, at least as far as boys are concerned. Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn have a rich and renewable legacy. And it may be that association that imparts a novelistic vibe to Ira Sachs’s “Little Men,” beyond the Louisa May Alcott echo in the title. It’s a subtle movie, alert to the almost imperceptible currents of feeling that pass between its title characters. They are Jake Jardine (Theo Taplitz) and Tony Calvelli (Michael Barbieri) two middle schoolers who cross paths in Brooklyn. I almost ended that sentence “and fall in love,” a possibly misleading but not at all inaccurate account of what happens. The childhood bond that the psychologist Harry Stack Sullivan called “chumship” can be as intense and mysterious as romantic love, and can be sparked by the kind of intuitive connection that arises between Jake and Tony when they first meet. Jake, pale and reserved, is an exile from Manhattan, flung across the East River by the tides of family fortune. His father, Brian (Greg Kinnear) might be described as a struggling actor if it didn’t seem that the fight had mostly gone out of him. He works, but he mostly worries, tries to be a nice guy and feels guilty when he fails at it. Jake’s mother, Kathy (Jennifer Ehle) who is a bit more decisive, is a therapist, and her smiling demeanor acts as a shield against the unspoken tensions hovering in the air whenever she and her husband are together. The family moves into an apartment that used to belong to Brian’s father, whose death is the movie’s precipitating catastrophe. The old man also owned the building where Tony’s mother, Leonor (Paulina García) runs a dress shop, and if “Little Men” is a love story it is also a tale of economic conflict in a rapidly changing city, a fable about the insidious, toxic power of money and real estate. Jake’s grandfather is recalled as a   bohemian of the kind that used to be more plentiful in New York. “He loved me,” Leonor says, perhaps hinting that they were lovers but more pointedly explaining why he charged her so little rent. Brian, urged on by his sister, wants to raise it. As the dispute between them escalates, it casts a shadow over Jake’s relationship with Tony. All the   think they are being perfectly reasonable as they dig in their heels and allow a business matter to turn into a personal grudge. None of them can help it everyone needs money. Their behavior  —   the politesse that grows increasingly cold, the contempt that seethes among people who believe themselves to be not only right but righteous  —   is dismaying, but hardly surprising. It’s also not really the point. Mr. Sachs holds the adults at arm’s length, declining either to judge them too harshly for their selfishness or to extend them more than minimal sympathy for their difficulties. In other words, “Little Men” is on the side of Jake and Tony, as both a narrative strategy and a moral choice. Their temperaments and backgrounds are different, as are their interests. Jake is a hothouse flower, his artistic talents and sensitivities carefully cultivated by his parents. Tony, whose father travels for work and is almost never at home (Hernan, a friend of Leonor’s played by Alfred Molina, is around a lot) is more of a   kid. He’s gregarious and easygoing and dreams of being an actor. The two boys conceive a plan to apply to a specialized arts high school together. When parents are around, “Little Men” feels like a modest, precise drama of urban life, but when it follows Tony and Jake, absorbing the loose rhythms of their companionship, the film becomes something richer and harder to classify. It’s a boys adventure story edged with unspoken risks, and the young actors take the kind of chances that their more careful and disciplined elders have been trained to avoid. There are inklings of sexual desire between the boys and implications of homophobia in the world around them, but mostly there is a sense of discovery and change, of all the unruly and enigmatic experiences often collapsed into the phrase “  . ” There is also a protest against the banal imperatives of maturity, and above all against the ways that adults ignore and discount the emotional lives of the young. Kathy, Brian and Leonor would do anything for their sons except take their relationship seriously, and the possibility that something as precious and real as friendship could be sacrificed because of money registers as a profound insult. And also as a fact of life. Mr. Sachs, in his last three features  —   this one, “Love Is Strange” and “Keep the Lights On”  —   has refined a style of emotional realism that stands out against both the mumbly diffidence and the sociological scorekeeping of too much independent American cinema. “Little Men” only looks like a small movie. “Little Men” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Parental guidance is the worst.

969,18384,Oscar-Nominated Shorts: Unsung but Worth Your Time - The New York Times,New York Times,A.O. Scott,2/9/2017,2017,2,,"If you need a distraction from fighting about “La La Land,” cheering at “Hidden Figures” or weeping about “Moonlight”  —   all of which might have been distracting you from other things  —   there are 15   movies quietly soliciting your attention, along with that of the academy voters. The   nominees are often unsung   highlights, too easily overlooked except for   balloting purposes. This is a shame, since in about the time it would take to watch “Arrival” three times or “Toni Erdmann” twice, you could take a remarkably   tour of world cinema. Even in a generally strong year like this one, the shorts display a cosmopolitan breadth and a stylistic variety that the other categories often lack. The animated nominees include handmade as well as digital productions, and dark, adult themes as well as   charm and whimsy. The live action and documentary candidates tackle painful   material with compassion, courage and imagination (though sometimes also with conventional sentimentality). All of the films arrive in theaters in New York on Wednesday and nationwide on Friday and will be available Feb. 21 on many streaming platforms (though several can be found on various sites now). Here is a brief critical guide. Before it was a mighty fief within Disney’s Magic Kingdom, Pixar was a plucky and resourceful   and those roots are often most visible in its nonfeature offerings. This year’s, “Piper” (directed by Alan Barillaro and Marc Sondheimer) is a technical tour de force of feathers and foam about a fledgling seabird overcoming its fear of water with the encouragement of a firm but loving parent. (The story is a bit like “Moana” in reverse.) The   relationship seems to be a sturdy animation theme, figuring in Andrew Coats and Lou  ’s “Borrowed Time,” about a Western lawman dad and his Western lawman son, and Patrick Osborne’s “Pearl” (now on YouTube) about a rock ’n’ roll dad and his rock ’n’ roll daughter. All three of these films show how much can be done without dialogue, and offer a respite from the usual    cartoon fare that fills up the multiplexes. “Blind Vaysha,” a film by Theodore Ushev with folkloric, Eastern European overtones, is a bit talkier, with a narrator’s voice accompanying eerie,   images. “Pear Cider and Cigarettes,” the longest, richest and saddest of the films, also uses   narration to tell a painful personal story about the life and death of Techno Stypes, a   childhood friend of Robert Valley, who directed the film. (It’s available on Vimeo for a fee.) If I were voting, I’d go for Techno, but if I had to make a prediction, I’d never bet against Pixar. The predicament of migrants and refugees in Europe figures in two of the nominees, “Ennemis Intérieurs” (“Internal Enemies”) from France, and “Silent Nights,” from Denmark. The first, directed by Sélim Azzazi, consists mainly of a tense interview between two men, both of Arab descent, who have lived in France all their lives. The older man is a former convict applying for citizenship, the younger one a government official. Their conversation, which takes place in 1998, touches on terrorism, religion and the integrity of “La Republique,” issues that could hardly be more relevant as France approaches a possibly fateful presidential election. “Silent Nights” confronts similar questions as it traces the relationship between a young Danish woman and a Ghanaian immigrant, whose mutual empathy (and romantic attraction) is tested by the drastically different circumstances they face. The humanism of this film, directed by Aske Bang and Kim Magnusson, is shadowed by an inescapable pessimism, an intimation that kindness, while essential, may not be enough when survival is at stake. There is nothing overtly topical or political in the other three nominees, which are also from Europe. “La Femme et le TGV” (“The Woman and the TGV,” available for a fee from iTunes) from Switzerland, is almost rescued from mawkish triviality by the affecting performance of the great Jane Birkin as the title character, and nearly ruined by a cloying, aggressive score. The Spanish film “Timecode,” about the clandestine activities of parking garage security guards, might seem equally slight, but it reveals itself to be a sly fable of creative resistance in the face of deadening routine. And Kristof Deak and Anna Udvardy’s “Sing,” my favorite in this batch, might be mistaken for a sweet story of the friendship between two Hungarian schoolgirls until the last scene, when it becomes a parable of defiance against unjust and corrupt authority. (Hey, teacher! Leave those kids alone!) Like the nominees in the   best documentary category, the five films in this group demonstrate a commitment to both relevance and experimentation. Only one of them, “Joe’s Violin” (now on YouTube) follows the conventional,   template, alternating interviews, archival footage and   events as it tells the touching story of a Holocaust survivor who donated his violin to a public school in the Bronx. The film, directed by Kahane Cooperman, proceeds though familiar beats, but its emotions are genuine and its characters are well worth knowing. Their lives are not easy, but “Joe’s Violin” feels downright soothing alongside its competition, which includes some of the most wrenching, unsparing images I have seen on film in the past year. The aptly named “Extremis,” by Dan Krauss (on Netflix now) plunges the viewer into the midst of gravely ill patients and the doctors who must help their families decide whether to continue life support. The reality of death is something we often avoid, and even for half an hour, this film is difficult to watch. But it is also gripping, suspenseful and moving  —   a hard look at a hard subject. Those words also describe the three short documentaries about the Syrian war and the European refugee crisis. Daphne Matziaraki’s “4. 1 Miles” (produced by The New York Times’s Opinion section and available on nytimes. com) plies the waters off the Greek island of Lesbos as coast guard officers try to rescue migrants crowded onto inflatable rafts. “The White Helmets,” by Orlando von Einsiedel and Joanna Natasegara (now on Netflix) and “Watani: My Homeland,” by Marcel Mettelsiefen and Stephen Ellis, both take place in Aleppo, and provide a glimpse of the horror that city has endured in recent years. Too rigorous to offer false hope, they nonetheless affirm the necessity of witness and an antidote to despair. I can’t choose between them, but I hope one of them wins.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5143,23004,"Carrie Fisher, a Princess, a Rebel and a Brave Comic Voice - The New York Times",New York Times,A.O. Scott,12/28/2016,2016,12,,"Carrie Fisher was the child of a   family. “The daughter of famous parents,” she wrote in her memoir “Wishful Drinking,” which originated as a   show. “One an icon, the other a consort to icons. ” She entered popular culture as a princess in peril and endures as something much more complicated and interesting. Many things, really: a rebel commander a witty internal critic of the celebrity machine a teller of comic tales, true and embellished an inspiring and cautionary avatar of excess and resilience an emblem of the honesty we crave (and so rarely receive) from beloved purveyors of  . When I heard the news of Ms. Fisher’s death on Tuesday, what immediately popped into my mind was not “Star Wars” but “Rosemary’s Baby”  —   that unforgettable episode from Season 2 of “30 Rock,” in which she turns up as a legendary and colossally difficult television writer, Rosemary Howard. [ Read Carrie Fisher’’s obituary ] Liz Lemon, the   television writer played (and created) by Tina Fey, idolizes Rosemary, seeing her as a pioneer and a spiritual mother. But even symbolic   relationships have a way of turning dysfunctional, and Liz comes to see Rosemary less as a beacon than a warning  —   an image of the cynical, resentful,   dingbat Liz herself might well become. Emily Nussbaum, the New Yorker’s television critic, remarked on Twitter that the episode was “the     of female comedy,” which may actually be an understatement. The character of Rosemary Howard certainly embodies the glories and contradictions of   feminism, and Liz’s ambivalence about her is a barbed and brilliant illustration of the anxieties of female comic influence. But the casting of Ms. Fisher  —   whose performance on the show is somehow at once wildly winking and completely    —   adds about 12 dimensions of meta. Anyone watching that episode will already know that Liz Lemon is a rabid “Star Wars” fan. Her default Halloween costume is Princess Leia Organa. Later, when she wants to get out of jury duty, Liz will coil her hair over her ears and dress in a belted linen djellaba, confident that no judge would ever impanel such a cosplaying nerd. She’s wrong about that, and also wrong to sell out her Leia devotion, treating it as a source of embarrassment rather than power and pride. The princess allows Liz  —   and not only Liz  —   to be both geek and warrior, sex symbol and samurai, free spirit and prisoner of the corporate Death Star. Liz Lemon has two mothers, both played by Carrie Fisher. That statement can stand as a fictional index of Ms. Fisher’s extensive   influence. Princess Leia  —   now General Organa of the Rebel Alliance  —   will always define her as an actress, something she claimed, in a recent Rolling Stone interview, not to mind. “I like Princess Leia,” she said. “I like how she was feisty. I like how she killed Jabba the Hutt. ” That feistiness has been Leia’s principal legacy, the early sign of a shift in the understanding of female heroism  —   and the meanings of the word princess  —   that has rippled through popular culture in the past 40 years. Leia is a foremother of Hermione Granger and Katniss Everdeen and of countless   Disney princesses. She also foretold the recent, somewhat belated feminist turn in the “Star Wars” cycle itself. All of a sudden, and at long last, Leia is not the only   heroine in the galaxy, having been joined by Rey in “The Force Awakens” and Jyn in “Rogue One. ” Ms. Fisher’s legacy may rest at least as much on her literary voice, on the alter egos she created on the page, as on any character she played onscreen. She was hardly the first or the only Hollywood figure to spill the beans about sex, drugs and other   shenanigans. Nor was she unique among writers in the way she mined her own painful history of addiction and mental illness for harrowing and humorous copy. But “Postcards From the Edge,” her 1987 roman à clef about a movie star named Suzanne Vale with a cocaine problem and a difficult   mom, bristles with a bravery and candor that still feels groundbreaking. She went there, long before that was a catchphrase, and before that particular there was such a crowded piece of real estate. In her Rolling Stone interview and elsewhere, Ms. Fisher liked to cite Dorothy Parker as an inspiration. She carried that tradition forward, and the frank, funny, confessionally inclined and   women who now flourish on television and in print  —   the list is too long they know who they are  —   are in her debt. “You’re my kid!” Rosemary Howard cries out to Liz Lemon. An echo of the famous assertion of paternity in the “Star Wars” saga. And also an acknowledgment of Carrie Fisher’s own undeniable status as a matriarch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2445,20014,Frederick Wiseman: The Filmmaker Who Shows Us Ourselves - The New York Times,New York Times,A.O. Scott and Manohla Dargis,4/10/2017,2017,4,,"One of the most important and original filmmakers working today, Frederick Wiseman has been making documentaries for 50 years. His movies are about specific places  —   institutions, organizations, cities and communities: the New York neighborhood of Jackson Heights the coastal town of Belfast, Me. the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind American Ballet Theater the National Gallery in London. What interests Mr. Wiseman is how these institutions reflect the larger society and what they reveal about human behavior. His documentaries can be long. The   and   running times might seem forbidding, but there is rarely a dull moment, in spite of the absence of conventional narrative. Very quickly, you find yourself absorbed in patterns and details as meaning emerges   surfacing moment by moment, encounter by encounter, in bodies and faces alone and in groups. In “Basic Training,” men become soldiers order by order and step by step. In “Deaf,” students learn to speak through sounds and gestures, repeating words and sentences with their teachers until communication is achieved. There can be an abstract, mechanical quality to the way bodies function in these institutions, but even as people can look like moving parts in a large machine, the camera registers their individuality. Mr. Wiseman’s great subject is human beings, in all of their  —   of our  —   variety and uniqueness. On Friday, April 14, the first half of a complete retrospective of his work begins at Film Forum. It’s a fitting tribute and arrives at a particularly productive moment for this prolific director, who in November received an honorary Academy Award. A ballet based on his 1967 film, “Titicut Follies,” opened last month in Minneapolis, and he has completed a new documentary, “Ex Libris,” about the New York Public Library, due later this year. “What’s kept me going,” Mr. Wiseman, who is 87, said upon receiving his Oscar, “is that it’s fun and an adventure. Constantly working also keeps me off the street, or at least on the streets that I like. ” What follows is a very partial introduction to some of the highlights and defining themes of his distinctive and capacious body of work. “The ideas of the movie came out of the absolute sense of shock about what Bridgewater was about,” Mr. Wiseman once said of his most notorious film, which takes place in the state prison for the criminally insane at Bridgewater, Mass. A principled and gravely disturbing look into the void, it remains an appalling inquiry into penal abuse. What Mr. Wiseman found was too much for Massachusetts, which sought to ban the film for, as a trial judge put it in 1967, an “unwarranted” intrusion into the “right to privacy of each inmate. ” The legal wrangling centered on the inmates’ rights versus the public’s right to know and opened a constellation of issues involving documentary ethics and thorny questions of informed consent. Unlike Mr. Wiseman, the film’s opponents were uncomfortably silent on the prison’s barbarism and basic human rights, and at times seemed more concerned with the reputation of Massachusetts than with the inmates’ welfare. In 1969, its Supreme Court suggested as much: “There is a collective, indecent intrusion into the most private aspects of the lives of these unfortunate persons in the Commonwealth’s custody. ” The ban on public screenings remained in place until 1991. Now, 50 years later, the film can be seen for what it was: a work of political art and moral outrage. (Manohla Dargis) Mr. Wiseman’s documentaries are about institutions  —   the bricks, mortar, endless meetings and all the moving parts  —   including all the moving, walking and talking people who go into making them. A consummate dialectician, he likes to toggle between the general and the specific, creating a kind of accordion effect as images of buildings give way to images of people inside those buildings and longer views oscillate with   of faces and body parts. In “Blind” (1986) fingers trace Braille dots in “Boxing Gym” (2010) the focus turns to fists and   feet. In his 1971 film “Basic Training,” Mr. Wiseman followed a company of drafted and enlisted men at Fort Knox, Ky. as it is put through its paces. He shot the movie in the summer of 1970, after the first Vietnam draft lottery was instituted, and it is populated with achingly young men as they become a marching, shooting, “Yes, sir”  unit. It’s a stark, dehumanizing process filled with bracingly human moments, as when a black soldier accused of not following orders tells a white soldier: “Let’s be frank with each other, now you know this is not my country. ” One of the film’s most haunting moments takes place during a combat exercise. By then, the soldiers are marching in sync  —   chanting “Mr. Nixon dropped the   I don’t want to go to ’Nam”  —   and seemingly ready for war. With their faces smeared in camouflage paint and leaves stuck on their helmets, they practice their moves, silently raising and lowering arms and legs to the sounds of buzzing insects. As one man lifts his arm, the camera follows the upward motion and then pauses on his delicate hand poised against the sky. It’s a   image: With fingers as thin as a Gothic Jesus, this hand was made to kill and belongs to a man who might die. (M. D.) Political activists in the ’60s used to joke that “freedom is an endless meeting. ” Mr. Wiseman, who began his career as a filmmaker in that decade, has a preoccupation with process that may be a generational characteristic. Or it may just be that he’s a sensitive chronicler of modern life, an enormous proportion of which consists of committee work. A meeting  —   formal or informal, routine or hastily gathered, tedious or contentious  —   amounts to a Wiseman signature, like a shootout in a Tarantino movie or a dirty joke in a Judd Apatow comedy. When a group of people gather in a room, the business of the world is being done (or postponed or discussed or avoided, which amounts to the same thing). More crucial, it is being witnessed, by the camera and the audience, so that essential information can be imparted about the workings of law and order, art and politics, knowledge and power. If you listen closely, you can glean useful insights into such matters. But you also gain a kind of ecstatic anthropological insight into rituals that are both banal and outlandish, and an initiation into the mysteries of human psychology. You notice posture and gesture, who talks too much and who stays silent, who is passive and who is aggressive. Meetings are the most quotidian moments in a Wiseman documentary, but also, often, the most intriguing. They are nuggets of real life and eruptions of pure theater. (A. O. Scott) Action leads to reaction, and sometimes a push earns a   shove. That’s true throughout Mr. Wiseman’s work, which is filled with people  —   teachers, guards, bureaucrats, choreographers  —   telling other people what to do and how to do it, as well as where, when and why. Some of this can seem benign, as when executives in “National Gallery” (2014) meet to discuss the London museum of the title. When that talk turns to branding, though, and voices start to sharpen, a meeting about prestige, publicity and populism evolves into a larger debate about survival  —   as well as one very civilized power struggle. In other Wiseman films, power is brutal and blunt. That’s particularly true in the earlier films, in which the    images are sometimes matched by a startling Manicheanism. The harrowing “Law and Order” (1969) follows a mostly white police force in Kansas City, Mo. as its members go on patrol, answer calls and, in one case, bring a lost, weeping toddler back to the station. It’s a moment of    gentleness amid more difficult, at times violent encounters between cops and civilians, as in a horrifying scene in which a white plainclothes detective puts a chokehold on a black prostitute, an action so harsh her tongue juts out of her mouth. It’s a dreadful, terrifying moment and, for this filmmaker, unusual in its viciousness. Generally, violence in Mr. Wiseman’s work remains implied and attenuated, and more a matter of ordinary domination. Few images will seem as familiar to viewers as the scene in “High School” (1968) when an official  —   the camera tagging behind  —   patrols one of the school’s   halls, demanding passes and ordering students to class. As he shoots out questions  —   “What are you doin’ here? ,” “Where you goin’? ,” “Pass?”  —   this disciplinarian isn’t just corralling kids, he is, of course, also preparing them for lives of 9 to 5 submission. Woe to the resisters! (M. D.) One of modern cinema’s great observers, Mr. Wiseman is also a prodigious listener, a visual artist who thinks like a musical composer. He harvests sounds along with images  —   in many of his films he operates the recording equipment as well as the camera  —   and shapes the material with an eye and ear for patterns and counterpoint, themes and variations. In most documentaries, human speech is explanatory and expository: Much information is conveyed by means of   narration and   interviews. Mr. Wiseman avoids these techniques entirely. When people talk in his movies, they aren’t explaining themselves to us they’re expressing themselves to one another. We eavesdrop not only to figure out what’s happening, but also to attend to idioms and rhythms, to the musical qualities of speech. We tune in to the ways language is used by deaf and blind children as well as by judges, politicians and teachers, and also to the different ways it sounds. But words aren’t all we hear. We hear the cadence of boxers’ dancers’ and soldiers’ feet the lapping of waves on the side of a boat the whooshing of skis on an Aspen slope the sighing of the wind in the trees of Central Park. (A. O. S.) The boundaries of New York neighborhoods are determined more by local custom and   industry hype than by law or charter. This makes “In Jackson Heights”  —   about a polyglot,    section of Queens  —   an anomaly in the Wiseman canon. Its setting is not a town or an institution, but something with a less definite shape and a more informal reason for being. Jackson Heights in an accident of demography, geography and zoning. Or maybe it’s a community, a place given coherence by the rough serendipity of strangers adjusting to one another’s presence. Who are they? How do they live together? How do they make it work? (“It” being that elusive thing we like to call democracy.) One answer, hardly surprising in a Wiseman film, is through meetings. We observe gatherings of senior citizens, gay and lesbian residents and recent immigrants. Their conversations are by turns personal, practical and philosophical, and they revolve around the fundamental issues of civic order, which are shown to be at once mundane and grand. How do we keep our streets safe? How do we balance rights and obligations? How do we pursue prosperity without trampling our cherished traditions and common spaces? The wonder of “In Jackson Heights”  —   Mr. Wiseman’s most Whitmanesque film  —   is that it grounds a vision of America in the particulars of daily life. It discovers a hero in the person of Daniel Dromm, a New York City councilman who tackles the job of representing his neighborhood with shambling, inexhaustible good cheer. Some of the most moving scenes take place in Mr. Dromm’s office, where members of his staff answer phone calls from constituents who need to talk to someone in government. They don’t always have the right branch  —   their concerns include constitutional law and United States military policy  —   but the courtesy and patience with which they are treated provide a timely and permanent lesson in democratic values.

7039,25515,Killers on a Shoestring: Inside the Gangs of El Salvador - The New York Times,New York Times,"Óscar Martínez, Efren Lemus, Carlos Martínez and Deborah Sontag",11/21/2016,2016,11,,"SAN SALVADOR  —   On a sultry evening in late July, the Salvadoran authorities executed their very first assault on what they called the financial cupola of Mara Salvatrucha, or   the largest of the ruthless gangs that have made El Salvador the murder capital of the world. Until that point, the National Civil Police had followed an almost choreographed routine, again and again, as they sought to cripple the gangs economically. In the dead of night, often accompanied by television cameras, officers would batter down the doors of ramshackle houses in marginalized communities and then arrest and put on display a cluster of tattooed and   men. Between 2012 and 2015, the total amount confiscated in these showy   raids was $34, 664. 75  —   an absurdly tiny sum considering that the United States has designated   as a global criminal organization on a par with the Zetas of Mexico, or the Yakuza of Japan. On July 27, however, in a mission baptized Operation Check, the authorities shifted gears. They deployed 1, 127 police officers to raid scores of supposed gang fronts, including car dealerships and bars, motels and brothels. With great fanfare, they presented to the news media rows and rows of impounded buses and cars, along with 77 suspects identified as the financial operatives of   and their collaborators. Among them were the supposed C. E. O. of the street gang, Marvin Ramos Quintanilla, and two other leaders portrayed as controlling millions and possessing luxuries unimaginable to the destitute gang members beneath them. But the presentation was something of an exaggeration, as are many official characterizations of the gangs whose criminal sophistication and global reach tend to be overstated by authorities frustrated that they cannot vanquish them. For instance, that supposed chief executive officer hardly lived like a kingpin he leased a squat concrete house with a corrugated roof in a neighborhood where rents rarely reach $400. He owned an old Honda Civic and a Nissan van. In collaboration with The New York Times, El Faro, a digital newspaper based in San Salvador, sought to pierce the secrecy surrounding the finances of the gangs that terrorize El Salvador, which is experiencing a level of deadly violence unparalleled outside war zones: 103 homicides per 100, 000 residents last year, compared with five in the United States. With an estimated 60, 000 members in a country of 6. 5 million people, the gangs hold power disproportionate to their numbers. They maintain a menacing presence in 247 of 262 municipalities. They extort about 70 percent of businesses. They dislodge entire communities from their homes, and help propel thousands of Salvadorans to undertake dangerous journeys to the United States. Their violence costs El Salvador $4 billion a year, according to a study by the country’s Central Reserve Bank. And yet, the reporting determined,   and its rival street gangs in El Salvador are not sophisticated transnational criminal enterprises. They do not begin to belong in the same financial league with the   Mexican, Japanese and Russian syndicates with which they are grouped. If they are mafias, they are mafias of the poor. El Salvador has been brought to its knees by an army of flies.  ’s annual revenue appears to be about $31. 2 million. That estimate is based on information in the   file of Operation Check, to which El Faro got exclusive access. Wiretapped conversations reveal that the gang’s national leadership ordered its 49 “programs,” or chapters, to turn over all the money earned in a single, typical week, which happened to be in April. It collected $600, 852. It sounds like a lot of money. But if divided equitably among the estimated 40, 000 members of   each gang member would earn $15 a week and about $65 a month. That is half the minimum wage of an agricultural day laborer. But the gangs  —     and its main rival, the 18th Street gang  —   do not distribute their proceeds equitably. They use them to pay for lawyers and funeral services, for weapons and munitions, and for the support of those serving long prison terms and their families. Theirs is a criminal subsistence economy even many of their leaders are barely solvent. “That the authorities call them ‘businessmen’  —   either their intelligence is invalid or it’s pretty crude,” said Rolando Monroy, a former Salvadoran prosecutor who oversaw   investigations until 2013. “The gangs are like an anthill. They are all after the same thing: something to eat. ” Unlike other groups considered global organized crime syndicates, the Salvadoran gangs do not survive on the international trafficking of cocaine, arms and humans. While they dabble in   drug dealing, gun sales and prostitution, they engage primarily in a single crime committed over and over within Salvadoran territory: extortion. Inside El Salvador, they hold the reins of power largely because of a chilling demand repeated  —   or implied  —   daily across the country: Pay or die. “Look, the thing is we’re not joking around,” said one threat in childlike handwriting delivered to a bus owner recently. “Get something together. If not, we are going to burn one of your new minibuses. ” It was signed by the 18th Street gang: “18 sends its best. ” At 4 p. m. on a summer day in 2015, two young gang members intercepted a businessman as he was returning home from work. “I have kids. Calm down, please,” he managed to say before the youths grabbed him, threw him to the ground and shot him: in a shoulder, in the stomach, and twice in the face. They were delivering a message written in lead. “It was because of the extortion, not for any other reason,” the man’s son said. The man owned a bus. His son, who also owned a bus, said his father, tired of being extorted, had finally stopped making his $1 daily payment to the gang three weeks before his death. It murdered him because of $21. Among Salvadoran businesses, transportation companies, whose vehicles crisscross gang territory, have proved especially vulnerable to extortion. Over the last five years, it has been more dangerous to drive a bus than to fight gang crime: The gangs have killed 692 transportation workers  —   and 93 police officers. (This is according to an analysis of internal government data that, like most data in this article, is not considered public information but was obtained by El Faro.) Genaro Ramírez, the owner of a large bus company and a former member of Congress, calculates that he has handed over $500, 000 in gang extortion payments over the last 19 years. “It’s a matter of survival,’’ he said. “When they tell you they are going to kill you, you don’t have a choice. ” Between 2013 and 2015, the National Police received 7, 506 reports of extortion, which the authorities see as just a small fraction of the total. In the same period, some 424 gang members were convicted of this crime, most of them   people who made the pickups and were caught with the cash. The payment of extortion by bus companies is so commonplace that some have employees whose principal role is to negotiate with the gangs, which are continually raising their rates and demanding extras like Christmas bonuses or buses to take them to the beach or to the funerals of associates. The only transportation company chief who has refused to be extorted  —   and has made his refusal public  —   is Catalino Miranda. Mr. Miranda owns a fleet of several hundred buses. Since 2004, the gangs have killed 26 of his employees. But he refuses to reconsider his position. “As I told one of them,” he said, referring to a gang representative, “go ahead and kill them. This cannot continue for a lifetime. ” Mr. Miranda spoke in his office, with a   pistol lying atop a mess of papers on his desk, and rifles and flak jackets piled in a corner. He spends $30, 000 a month on security, he said. He has cameras posted in all his buses and stations, and eight security guards, armed with assault weapons, who patrol the gang zones his buses move through. When his employees are killed, he hires private detectives to investigate, because “the state does not have the capacity to protect witnesses. ” “They use you,” Mr. Miranda continued, “and they abandon you. ” Resisting the gangs is not an option for   owners, however. Many of them live in   neighborhoods themselves and cannot escape the pressure to pay. That was the situation for the bus owner killed in the summer of 2015. The bus owner’s son, who is 38, spoke of his father’s death in an   restaurant beside the   Highway. The son carried a pistol  —   he always has one by his side, even when he sleeps, he said  —   and sat facing the entrance, with his back to a ravine, so he could track comings and goings. Like most businessmen who recounted their experiences with shakedowns, the man spoke on the condition of anonymity. His father was one of 154 transportation workers who lost their lives to   extortion rings in 2015. To talk is to risk becoming another statistic. It all started one afternoon in 2004, he recounted, when a couple of teenage gangsters boarded a bus on their route. The youths demanded the driver’s license and registration, reviewed the documents and then handed the driver a disposable phone before jumping off. After the shaken driver returned to the terminal, the phone rang. The voice on the other end laid out the terms of their new relationship: $10 a week not just for the one bus but for each of the 10 buses on the route. The man, his father and the other bus owners held an emergency meeting to discuss whether to report the demand to the police. Many victims do not bother. Extortion investigations require them to make payments to the gangs while the police watch and collect evidence. But the gangs almost always find out, and the victim is threatened or killed before the investigation is completed. Even so, the men decided to call the police. Soon, two detectives stationed themselves inside their terminal and, posing as bus owners, negotiated a rate with the gang: $1 a day per bus. Over the next three years, the police arrested three gang leaders, including one who lived next door to the man’s father. The investigation expanded to other crimes and dragged on. The bus owners kept paying extortion. The situation deteriorated. Between 2004 and 2012,   killed five bus drivers on their routes and one of the police investigators assigned to their case. In 2012, the gang tried to kill the man himself, surrounding his house, he said at the restaurant. After his father’s murder, the gang increased its extortion on the route  —   to $1. 50 a day. The man sold his bus. When the Salvadoran authorities draw a flow chart of  ’s organizational structure, they always put a mug shot of El Diablito de Hollywood, the Little Devil of Hollywood, at the very top. Hierarchically, El Diablito  —   Borromeo Henríquez Solórzano, 38  —   is as far above “homeboy” as one can get. If gang leaders are enriching themselves at the expense of the rank and file, Mr. Henríquez should be the wealthiest capo di tutti. And yet. In the late 1970s or early 1980s, Mr. Henríquez and his family fled the Salvadoran civil war along with thousands of their compatriots who resettled in Los Angeles neighborhoods dominated by Mexican gangs. Mara Salvatrucha was born there and then. At the end of the 1990s, as part of an   offensive and a crackdown on “criminal aliens,” the United States shipped planeloads of gang members made in the United States back to El Salvador and other Central American countries. El Diablito returned to his homeland in one of those waves of deportation. He was just a teenager, but in that era coming from Los Angeles conferred status in the branch of Mara Salvatrucha that had sprouted in El Salvador. (Loosely affiliated but largely autonomous branches now exist in other Central American countries and in pockets of the United States outside California.) It was like arriving with a seal of “original product,” and El Diablito, clever and garrulous, quickly parlayed that into a position of power. Prison, where he was sent in 1998 after getting a   sentence for homicide, only solidified his stature. Soon after he was first locked up, Mr. Henríquez summoned the leader of one of Mara Salvatrucha’s most powerful cells to visit him in prison, the leader related in an interview. At that time, the gang had no reliable revenue stream, though members sold drugs on street corners, committed petty robberies and demanded small handouts from bus drivers. But Mr. Henríquez had a moneymaking plan, he told the leader. El Diablito said he wanted to institutionalize extortion nationwide, the leader related. He was insistent that the leader accede to the plan, or quit:   would tolerate no dissidents. The leader communicated the new directive to his troops. A few years later, the leader quit and emigrated to Washington, D. C. where he now owns a small business in a Salvadoran neighborhood. Like El Diablito, most of the national gang leaders operate from behind bars. Through ready access to cellphones and private visits with lawyers, they retain tight control of their organizations  —   the money the gangs earn and the havoc they wreak. This became chillingly apparent in 2012 when the government was negotiating a truce with the gangs and Mr. Henríquez was emerging into the public eye as a spokesman for  . The leaders sent out an order from behind bars: Stop killing. And from one day to the next, homicides dropped 60 percent to a level that, with small variations, was maintained until the government’s negotiations with the gangs, which were highly unpopular, ended two years later. During the truce, a team from El Faro was allowed to interview gang leaders in the Ciudad Barrios jail, which was dominated by  . For over a decade, the gangs have been separated by institution to reduce internecine warfare this has had the unintended effect of strengthening them by uniting rather than dispersing their leadership. Dressed   in baggy, black athletic attire, Mr. Henríquez insisted that he survived on money sent by relatives in the United States and by a brother who sold used cars in El Salvador. “Do you realize it is difficult to believe that one of the most visible leaders of   does not derive a penny of his income from illicit activities?” a reporter from El Faro said. Mr. Henríquez paused, then responded: “My money does not come from extortion. ” But he was pressed: What about illicit activities more generally? El Diablito answered with a derisive smile: “It doesn’t come from extortion. ” And all the other gang leaders laughed, cryptically. That year  —   2012  —   the United States Treasury Department designated   as a transnational criminal organization, alongside four criminal syndicates: the Zetas, the Yakuza, the Russian Brothers’ Circle and the Italian Camorra. It was the first street gang that had ever received that designation. The next year, the Treasury put personal sanctions on Mr. Henríquez, which had the effect of forbidding Americans to do business with him and authorizing federal investigators to freeze his financial assets. No evidence has surfaced that any of Mr. Henríquez’s properties or assets in the United States were frozen. Sanctions were also placed on El Diablito’s wife, Jenny Judith Corado. The Salvadoran government arrested her in 2013 and accused her of belonging to a Mara Salvatrucha extortion ring. It could not prove her connection to the ring, however she was freed and ordered to turn over the money that a judge considered the provenance of extortion: $50. Now, Ms. Corado does not appear to be enjoying a life of luxury or even comfort. With her children beside her, she spends her days hawking used clothing and lingerie from a stall constructed of tin cans in the busy public marketplace of San Salvador. In the news conference announcing Operation Check (as in the chess move) the authorities spoke of gang leaders’ “luxuries,” their “investments” and their “various millions of dollars. ” “These leaders are living a different life than the gang members beneath them,” Douglas Meléndez, the attorney general, said. “The gang members beneath them should know. ” It was a communiqué directed at the street, at those    gangsters who put their lives on the line for little tangible reward: While their leaders may have been preaching a doctrine of brotherhood, they were secretly enriching themselves at the expense of their brothers, their soldiers, their homeboys. The luxuries, however, consisted of 22 imported but used cars, each valued at about $8, 000. The confiscated cash amounted to $34, 500. And the investments numbered three: a taqueria and bar in Soyapango, a   community in the San Salvador metropolitan area a vegetable stand in a rural marketplace and a highway restaurant that is decorated with a deer’s head, offers karaoke and has three waiters who primarily serve buckets of beer bottles. The gangs’ credo of fraternity and equality does not allow for any personal gain at the expense of the brotherhood, and they at least theoretically enforce it brutally. “He who makes himself rich at the expense of the street is going to die,” a leader of the 18th Street gang said in an interview. So even a vegetable stand is a risky venture, and the wiretapped conversations in the Operation Check file reveal that some gang leaders went so far as to pay extortion fees to their own gangs on their private businesses in order to hide their involvement with them. Howard Cotto, the general director of the National Police, estimated in an interview that 50 to 70 gang leaders, including Mr. Henríquez, have accumulated some money or business interests. But only enough, he said, to permit their families to escape “conditions of poverty, overcrowding, unhealthy conditions and sheet metal” and have a chance at a future. “I cannot say the leaders are living in places of luxury,” he acknowledged. Most of the leaders, in fact, are expected to spend the rest of their lives in prison, either in solitary confinement or in malodorous cells shared with dozens of others. One day in 2014, an imprisoned leader of the 18th Street gang who goes by the alias Chiki was issuing instructions to a   gang member identified as Shaggy. Speaking by phone from the Izalco penitentiary, Chiki, who was serving time for extortion, ordered Shaggy to make a pickup of an extortion payment. It was $100 from an operation in Colonia Rubio in the department of La Unión. And, though Shaggy risked up to 20 years in prison if caught, there was something special in it for him, Chiki said. “Keep two bucks so you can get yourself something to eat,” Chiki said, in what turned out to be a wiretapped conversation. He added: “And tell El Demente,” the Demented One, “to give you some custards for your kid. ” Chiki, whose real name is José Luis Guzmán, was the third in command of the 18th Street gang’s Southerners faction in eastern El Salvador. Another prison wiretap recording showed an even   18th Street leader, Carlos Ernesto Mojica, getting involved in negotiations with a chicken vendor who sought to lower her monthly extortion payment to $200 from $400. That these leaders were overseeing such   operations typifies the pettiness of gang business. While officials publicly portray the gangs as international criminal syndicates and   law enforcement records and data tell a different story  —   as do some authorities when speaking privately or in    interviews. In the four years before Operation Check, the biggest sum collected in a police   raid was $6, 377 some raids netted only $5. “I have never had a case involving the quantity of money necessary to maintain organized crime,” said Nora Montoya, a judge who has handled gang extortion cases for decades. Similarly, Mr. Cotto, the police director, said the term “ ” was “sensationalism” and could be misinterpreted as suggesting that Salvadoran street gangs were working directly with the Gulf Cartel or the Zetas in the transshipment of drugs from South America to the United States. “This is not the case. It is definitely not the case,” he said. Although Salvadoran gangs sell drugs, they do it like   dealers, not international operatives. From 2011 to 2015, the National Police seized 13. 9 kilograms of cocaine from gangs that was less than 1 percent of the total seized.   of the gang members prosecuted on drug charges over the last few years were charged with possessing less than an ounce. A veteran cocaine dealer in San Salvador said serious   organizations wanted nothing to do with the street gangs, which are considered unreliable and volatile. “The wholesalers I work with would not sell to the gang guys,” he said. “They don’t trust them. ” Over a decade ago, the police confiscated an account ledger from José Luis Mendoza Figueroa, a founder of   that contained no evidence of any drug business. Instead it showed weekly receipts that averaged $14 from the 19 “cliques”  —   the smallest gang units  —   he controlled, and trivial outlays for bullets ($8) taxis ($25) Christmas dinners, liquor and “$50 for the homeboys in prison. ” A couple of years ago, federal agents seized a similar ledger from the treasurer of the Park View Locos clique of the   in Usulután in southeast El Salvador. A log of one day’s expenses showed $30 for a cellphone chip, $10 for “mujer chief” (the chief’s wife or woman) $35 for “another woman” and $10 for food, with $29 listed as the balance. The notebook also contained the gang member’s grandiose musings: “The day I die I want to be remembered as a strong   soldier, a committed delinquent, and at the hour that the shots ring out, I want to be marked ‘present. ’” According to an internal code, only leaders can speak on behalf of the 18th Street gang. But in the rural department of La Paz, one of the most violent in El Salvador, a    gang member clambered to his feet from an old mattress on the dirt floor of a   house to defy that rule. He had agreed to grant an interview on two conditions: that his identity be protected, and that breakfast be provided. The boy, gangly and pimply, is a fledgling member of the 18th Street Revolutionaries, a faction of the 18th Street gang, and he works as an extremely   roadside extortionist. He collects $15 monthly from each of three food trucks that rumble through his district carrying chewing gum, Pepsi sodas and Bimbo bread. He then turns over the proceeds to the leader of his clique. “All the loot goes to weapons,” the youth said he himself was awarded a   pistol and many nights takes it out on “patrol. ” Like so many young recruits, the teenager is an obedient soldier who risks his life to protect his territory without earning a penny from his organization. It is a bargain for the gang leaders who manage the gang economy: tens of thousands of grunts who are not seeking personal profit, only respect and a sense of belonging. One of 14 children, the boy never went to school and does not know how to read or write. He probably could have found work in the nearby   fields, where, even if conditions were miserable, he would have earned $100 a month. But, feeling bullied and vulnerable at 13, he believed that gang membership would give him something less tangible but more valuable at that age. “I was a kid: I was stupid,” he said about joining. “A bunch of crazy guys were messing with me because I was a kid, smacking me in the head, knocking me around. It made me think: I have had enough. Since I joined up, nobody screws with me. ” The department of La Paz, with all its   production, is fairly lucrative for the gangs. The Federation of Associations of Sugar Cane Producers said in June that its members had paid $1. 5 million in extortion fees over a recent   period. But none of that trickles down to the rank and file. So in order to survive, the boy runs his own little racket on the side: “private extortion,” gang members call it. His particular clique forbids members to extort their neighbors. Instead, he collects and pockets “rent” from a few poor businesses on the periphery of his clique’s zone. He said he netted $40 a month  —   “only enough for what I’m going to eat. ” Despite his age, he is mostly left to fend for himself by a hapless mother with too many mouths to feed. While the teenage gang member talked, three of his little siblings circled the breakfast  —   scrambled eggs, beans and plantains  —   that waited in cartons on the floor. He gave his younger brother permission to open a carton. The little boy, who had matted hair and a dirty face, let out a squeal of delight, and proceeded to attack the meal with his hands. In two years of gang life, the teenager has already witnessed and participated in significant bloodshed. He said he had been involved in two “collective homicides. ” In both cases, members of a rival gang had dared to breach the invisible border that separates   from 18th Street territory. One man was looking to buy some marijuana the other to meet girls at a village festival. They were killed for their defiance. In the spring, the    leader of the teenager’s clique  —   whom he knew as Shadow  —   died in what the police described as a clash between the authorities and gang members. The boy was not present, but he had witnessed the deaths of three other clique members in February in another encounter described as a clash, he said. The boy said none of his homeboys had been carrying weapons that winter day. Hiding in a trash pile, he watched as the police killed his friends, teenagers like him, and then, he said, placed guns around their bodies to make it look as if they had fallen in crossfire. Two neighbors who are not gang members supported his version of events in interviews, and it is not  : El Salvador’s attorney general for human rights has 31 open cases against the police for alleged summary executions of 100 gang members over the last year and a half. The day of that interview and in   conversations throughout the summer, the boy made it clear he was scared of the police. Since February, officers had been stopping by his house from time to time, and he had spent much of his time hiding from them in the mountains. “I need to save money to get out of here,” he said. “If they catch me, they’re not going to let me live. ” They did catch him, in October, and arrested him for extorting $40  —   his private extortion  —   from a local merchant. He was jailed, and faces up to 15 years in prison. As violence peaked in 2015, reaching levels unseen since the aftermath of El Salvador’s long and brutal civil war, entire communities abandoned their homes because of gang threats. It became such a recurring phenomenon that television channels interrupted their programming to broadcast live the precise moment in which dozens of families fled, on foot or in pickup trucks tightly packed with suitcases, mattresses, chickens and pigs. Having failed to guarantee them daily security, the police nonetheless supervised their moves. Pedro González, the chief of the   unit, showed up at one mass exodus, from a condominium building in suburban San Salvador. After imploring residents in vain to stay put, he led them in an alternate response. “It doesn’t matter who here is Catholic or evangelical, let us raise a prayer,” he said. “That is the most important, let us turn to God. ” Over the years, the Salvadoran authorities have tried to quash the gangs with military might, to prosecute them into oblivion, to banish them with lengthy prison terms and, briefly, to negotiate with them. (The dialogue was corrupted by, among other things, the secret efforts of the two major political parties to court the gang leaders’ electoral support at the same time.) When the government ratcheted up its “iron fist” approach last year, three gangs, working in coordination, responded with a show of force. On a Sunday night, they distributed written and oral messages to bus owners and employees: “He who takes out a vehicle tomorrow is going to end up glued to his steering wheel. ” To underscore their seriousness, they killed a driver and burned three microbuses as a warning. The next day, six drivers who had disobeyed their order were killed. The authorities sent soldiers and tanks into the streets, and deployed government vehicles to substitute for the buses, but the gangs succeeded in almost completely paralyzing San Salvador’s transportation system for four days. Some 1. 3 million Salvadorans were affected many high schools and universities suspended classes and the economy suffered an $80 million loss, according to the Chamber of Commerce. It was a ruthless show of force. This year, with Operation Check, the government conducted one of its most professional law enforcement efforts to date, and comments by senior officials suggested a new willingness to approach the gangs as a complex phenomenon with deep roots in the profound inequalities of a country where a third of the population lives in poverty. Yet by hyping its findings, the government continued to misrepresent the gangs as sophisticated criminal organizations, ruthlessly driven by a thirst for financial gain. And though in Operation Check it acknowledged a distinction between the culpability of leaders and    members, that distinction was lost on the street. The authorities have continued to treat all gangsters as mortal enemies and have doubled down on their use of force. Some 424 gang members had died in confrontations with the police this year as of September. “If the use of force is not the correct path in this moment, at this stage, at this juncture, then what is? ’’ Óscar Ortiz, the country’s vice president, asked in late October. The government cites as evidence a recent drop in murders: 4, 431 by   compared with 5, 363 by that point in 2015. But that is still the second highest toll since 1995. In Operation Check, the government sought to sow dissent in gang ranks by portraying the leaders of   as   profiteers. Afterward, a written message sent out from a Mara   prison demanded that “justice” be meted out to those revealed by Operation Check to have betrayed the gang, according to an American official in El Salvador who monitors the gangs. As of yet, though, there do not seem to have been any revenge killings, internal purges or mass defections. For a gang member tired of the gang life, at any rate, there is nowhere to go. Those who are not incarcerated are marked, quite literally with tattoos, for life. There are no rehabilitation centers where they can seek refuge, no programs to reintegrate them into society and no   initiatives aimed at   youths. The only alternatives appear to be those that gang members themselves   on walls throughout the country: “Jail or the Cemetery. ”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

power or enough data. People on our side kept saying, ‘Yeah, but if I had a really big one, it would work. ’’u2009It wasn’t a very persuasive argument. ” When Pichai said that Google would henceforth be “A. I. first,” he was not just making a claim about his company’s business strategy he was throwing in his company’s lot with this   idea. Pichai’s allocation of resources ensured that people like Dean could ensure that people like Hinton would have, at long last, enough computers and enough data to make a persuasive argument. An average brain has something on the order of 100 billion neurons. Each neuron is connected to up to 10, 000 other neurons, which means that the number of synapses is between 100 trillion and 1, 000 trillion. For a simple artificial neural network of the sort proposed in the 1940s, the attempt to even try to replicate this was unimaginable. We’re still far from the construction of a network of that size, but Google Brain’s investment allowed for the creation of artificial neural networks comparable to the brains of mice. To understand why scale is so important, however, you have to start to understand some of the more technical details of what, exactly, machine intelligences are doing with the data they consume. A lot of our ambient fears about A. I. rest on the idea that they’re just vacuuming up knowledge like a sociopathic prodigy in a library, and that an artificial intelligence constructed to make paper clips might someday decide to treat humans like ants or lettuce. This just isn’t how they work. All they’re doing is shuffling information around in search of commonalities  —   basic patterns, at first, and then more complex ones  —   and for the moment, at least, the greatest danger is that the information we’re feeding them is biased in the first place. If that brief explanation seems sufficiently reassuring, the reassured nontechnical reader is invited to skip forward to the next section, which is about cats. If not, then read on. (This section is also, luckily, about cats.) Imagine you want to program a   on the old  . I. model. You stay up for days preloading the machine with an exhaustive, explicit definition of “cat. ” You tell it that a cat has four legs and pointy ears and whiskers and a tail, and so on. All this information is stored in a special place in memory called Cat. Now you show it a picture. First, the machine has to separate out the various distinct elements of the image. Then it has to take these elements and apply the rules stored in its memory. If( legs=4) and if( ears=pointy) and if( whiskers=yes) and if( tail=yes) and if( expression=supercilious) then( cat=yes). But what if you showed this   a Scottish Fold, a   breed with a prized genetic defect that leads to droopy   ears? Our symbolic A. I. gets to (ears=pointy) and shakes its head solemnly, “Not cat. ” It is hyperliteral, or “brittle. ” Even the thickest toddler shows much greater inferential acuity. Now imagine that instead of   the machine with a set of rules for classification stored in one location of the computer’s memory, you try the same thing on a neural network. There is no special place that can hold the definition of “cat. ” There is just a giant blob of interconnected switches, like forks in a path. On one side of the blob, you present the inputs (the pictures) on the other side, you present the corresponding outputs (the labels). Then you just tell it to work out for itself, via the individual calibration of all of these interconnected switches, whatever path the data should take so that the inputs are mapped to the correct outputs. The training is the process by which a labyrinthine series of elaborate tunnels are excavated through the blob, tunnels that connect any given input to its proper output. The more training data you have, the greater the number and intricacy of the tunnels that can be dug. Once the training is complete, the middle of the blob has enough tunnels that it can make reliable predictions about how to handle data it has never seen before. This is called “supervised learning. ” The reason that the network requires so many neurons and so much data is that it functions, in a way, like a sort of giant machine democracy. Imagine you want to train a computer to differentiate among five different items. Your network is made up of millions and millions of neuronal “voters,” each of whom has been given five different cards: one for cat, one for dog, one for spider monkey, one for spoon and one for defibrillator. You show your electorate a photo and ask, “Is this a cat, a dog, a spider monkey, a spoon or a defibrillator?” All the neurons that voted the same way collect in groups, and the network foreman peers down from above and identifies the majority classification: “A dog?” You say: “No, maestro, it’s a cat. Try again. ” Now the network foreman goes back to identify which voters threw their weight behind “cat” and which didn’t. The ones that got “cat” right get their votes counted double next time  —   at least when they’re voting for “cat. ” They have to prove independently whether they’re also good at picking out dogs and defibrillators, but one thing that makes a neural network so flexible is that each individual unit can contribute differently to different desired outcomes. What’s important is not the individual vote, exactly, but the pattern of votes. If Joe, Frank and Mary all vote together, it’s a dog but if Joe, Kate and Jessica vote together, it’s a cat and if Kate, Jessica and Frank vote together, it’s a defibrillator. The neural network just needs to register enough of a regularly discernible signal somewhere to say, “Odds are, this particular arrangement of pixels represents something these humans keep calling ‘cats. ’’u2009” The more “voters” you have, and the more times you make them vote, the more keenly the network can register even very weak signals. If you have only Joe, Frank and Mary, you can maybe use them only to differentiate among a cat, a dog and a defibrillator. If you have millions of different voters that can associate in billions of different ways, you can learn to classify data with incredible granularity. Your trained voter assembly will be able to look at an unlabeled picture and identify it more or less accurately. Part of the reason there was so much resistance to these ideas in   departments is that because the output is just a prediction based on patterns of patterns, it’s not going to be perfect, and the machine will never be able to define for you what, exactly, a cat is. It just knows them when it sees them. This wooliness, however, is the point. The neuronal “voters” will recognize a happy cat dozing in the sun and an angry cat glaring out from the shadows of an untidy litter box, as long as they have been exposed to millions of diverse cat scenes. You just need lots and lots of the voters  —   in order to make sure that some part of your network picks up on even very weak regularities, on Scottish Folds with droopy ears, for example  —   and enough labeled data to make sure your network has seen the widest possible variance in phenomena. It is important to note, however, that the fact that neural networks are probabilistic in nature means that they’re not suitable for all tasks. It’s no great tragedy if they mislabel 1 percent of cats as dogs, or send you to the wrong movie on occasion, but in something like a   car we all want greater assurances. This isn’t the only caveat. Supervised learning is a    process based on labeled data. The machines might be doing the learning, but there remains a strong human element in the initial categorization of the inputs. If your data had a picture of a man and a woman in suits that someone had labeled “woman with her boss,” that relationship would be encoded into all future pattern recognition. Labeled data is thus fallible the way that human labelers are fallible. If a machine was asked to identify creditworthy candidates for loans, it might use data like felony convictions, but if felony convictions were unfair in the first place  —   if they were based on, say, discriminatory drug laws  —   then the loan recommendations would perforce also be fallible.   networks like our   are only one of many varieties of deep learning, but they are disproportionately invoked as teaching examples because each layer does something at least vaguely recognizable to humans  —   picking out edges first, then circles, then faces. This means there’s a safeguard against error. For instance, an early oddity in Google’s   software meant that it could not always identify a barbell in isolation, even though the team had trained it on an image set that included a lot of exercise categories. A visualization tool showed them the machine had learned not the concept of “dumbbell” but the concept of “dumbbell+arm,” because all the dumbbells in the training set were attached to arms. They threw into the training mix some photos of solo barbells. The problem was solved. Not everything is so easy. Over the course of its first year or two, Brain’s efforts to cultivate in machines the skills of a    were auspicious enough that the team was graduated out of the X lab and into the broader research organization. (The head of Google X once noted that Brain had paid for the entirety of X’s costs.) They still had fewer than 10 people and only a vague sense for what might ultimately come of it all. But even then they were thinking ahead to what ought to happen next. First a human mind learns to recognize a ball and rests easily with the accomplishment for a moment, but sooner or later, it wants to ask for the ball. And then it wades into language. The first step in that direction was the cat paper, which made Brain famous. What the cat paper demonstrated was that a neural network with more than a billion “synaptic” connections  —   a hundred times larger than any publicized neural network to that point, yet still many orders of magnitude smaller than our brains  —   could observe raw, unlabeled data and pick out for itself a   human concept. The Brain researchers had shown the network millions of still frames from YouTube videos, and out of the welter of the pure sensorium the network had isolated a stable pattern any toddler or chipmunk would recognize without a moment’s hesitation as the face of a cat. The machine had not been programmed with the foreknowledge of a cat it reached directly into the world and seized the idea for itself. (The researchers discovered this with the   equivalent of something like an M. R. I. which showed them that a ghostly cat face caused the artificial neurons to “vote” with the greatest collective enthusiasm.) Most machine learning to that point had been limited by the quantities of labeled data. The cat paper showed that machines could also deal with raw unlabeled data, perhaps even data of which humans had no established foreknowledge. This seemed like a major advance not only in   studies but also in overall artificial intelligence. The lead author on the cat paper was Quoc Le. Le is short and willowy and   with a quick, enigmatic smile and shiny black penny loafers. He grew up outside Hue, Vietnam. His parents were rice farmers, and he did not have electricity at home. His mathematical abilities were obvious from an early age, and he was sent to study at a magnet school for science. In the late 1990s, while still in school, he tried to build a chatbot to talk to. He thought, How hard could this be? “But actually,” he told me in a whispery deadpan, “it’s very hard. ” He left the rice paddies on a scholarship to a university in Canberra, Australia, where he worked on A. I. tasks like computer vision. The dominant method of the time, which involved feeding the machine definitions for things like edges, felt to him like cheating. Le didn’t know then, or knew only dimly, that there were at least a few dozen computer scientists elsewhere in the world who couldn’t help imagining, as he did, that machines could learn from scratch. In 2006, Le took a position at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in the medieval German university town of Tübingen. In a reading group there, he encountered two new papers by Geoffrey Hinton. People who entered the discipline during the long diaspora all have conversion stories, and when Le read those papers, he felt the scales fall away from his eyes. “There was a big debate,” he told me. “A very big debate. ” We were in a small interior conference room, a narrow,   space outfitted with only a small table and two whiteboards. He looked to the curve he’d drawn on the whiteboard behind him and back again, then softly confided, “I’ve never seen such a big debate. ” He remembers standing up at the reading group and saying, “This is the future. ” It was, he said, an “unpopular decision at the time. ” A former adviser from Australia, with whom he had stayed close, couldn’t quite understand Le’s decision. “Why are you doing this?” he asked Le in an email. “I didn’t have a good answer back then,” Le said. “I was just curious. There was a successful paradigm, but to be honest I was just curious about the new paradigm. In 2006, there was very little activity. ” He went to join Ng at Stanford and began to pursue Hinton’s ideas. “By the end of 2010, I was pretty convinced something was going to happen. ” What happened, soon afterward, was that Le went to Brain as its first intern, where he carried on with his dissertation work  —   an extension of which ultimately became the cat paper. On a simple level, Le wanted to see if the computer could be trained to identify on its own the information that was absolutely essential to a given image. He fed the neural network a still he had taken from YouTube. He then told the neural network to throw away some of the information contained in the image, though he didn’t specify what it should or shouldn’t throw away. The machine threw away some of the information, initially at random. Then he said: “Just kidding! Now recreate the initial image you were shown based only on the information you retained. ” It was as if he were asking the machine to find a way to “summarize” the image, and then expand back to the original from the summary. If the summary was based on irrelevant data  —   like the color of the sky rather than the presence of whiskers  —   the machine couldn’t perform a competent reconstruction. Its reaction would be akin to that of a distant ancestor whose takeaway from his brief exposure to   tigers was that they made a restful swooshing sound when they moved. Le’s neural network, unlike that ancestor, got to try again, and again and again and again. Each time it mathematically “chose” to prioritize different pieces of information and performed incrementally better. A neural network, however, was a black box. It divined patterns, but the patterns it identified didn’t always make intuitive sense to a human observer. The same network that hit on our concept of cat also became enthusiastic about a pattern that looked like some sort of   compound, like a cross between an ottoman and a goat. Le didn’t see himself in those heady cat years as a language guy, but he felt an urge to connect the dots to his early chatbot. After the cat paper, he realized that if you could ask a network to summarize a photo, you could perhaps also ask it to summarize a sentence. This problem preoccupied Le, along with a Brain colleague named Tomas Mikolov, for the next two years. In that time, the Brain team outgrew several offices around him. For a while they were on a floor they shared with executives. They got an email at one point from the administrator asking that they please stop allowing people to sleep on the couch in front of Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s suite. It unsettled incoming V. I. P. s. They were then allocated part of a research building across the street, where their exchanges in the microkitchen wouldn’t be squandered on polite chitchat with the suits. That interim also saw dedicated attempts on the part of Google’s competitors to catch up. (As Le told me about his close collaboration with Tomas Mikolov, he kept repeating Mikolov’s name over and over, in an incantatory way that sounded poignant. Le had never seemed so solemn. I finally couldn’t help myself and began to ask, “Is he . .. ?” Le nodded. “At Facebook,” he replied.) They spent this period trying to come up with   architectures that could accommodate not only simple photo classifications, which were static, but also complex structures that unfolded over time, like language or music. Many of these were first proposed in the 1990s, and Le and his colleagues went back to those   contributions to see what they could glean. They knew that once you established a facility with basic linguistic prediction, you could then go on to do all sorts of other intelligent things  —   like predict a suitable reply to an email, for example, or predict the flow of a sensible conversation. You could sidle up to the sort of prowess that would, from the outside at least, look a lot like thinking. The hundred or so current members of Brain  —   it often feels less like a department within a colossal corporate hierarchy than it does a club or a scholastic society or an intergalactic cantina  —   came in the intervening years to count among the freest and most widely admired employees in the entire Google organization. They are now quartered in a tiered   eggshell building, with large windows tinted a menacing charcoal gray, on the leafy northwestern fringe of the company’s main Mountain View campus. Their microkitchen has a foosball table I never saw used a Rock Band setup I never saw used and a Go kit I saw used on a few occasions. (I did once see a young Brain research associate introducing his colleagues to ripe jackfruit, carving up the enormous spiky orb like a turkey.) When I began spending time at Brain’s offices, in June, there were some rows of empty desks, but most of them were labeled with   notes that said things like “Jesse,  . ” Now those are all occupied. When I first visited, parking was not an issue. The closest spaces were those reserved for expectant mothers or Teslas, but there was ample space in the rest of the lot. By October, if I showed up later than 9:30, I had to find a spot across the street. Brain’s growth made Dean slightly nervous about how the company was going to handle the demand. He wanted to avoid what at Google is known as a “success disaster”  —   a situation in which the company’s capabilities in theory outpaced its ability to implement a product in practice. At a certain point he did some     calculations, which he presented to the executives one day in a   presentation. “If everyone in the future speaks to their Android phone for three minutes a day,” he told them, “this is how many machines we’ll need. ” They would need to double or triple their global computational footprint. “That,” he observed with a little theatrical gulp and widened eyes, “sounded scary. You’d have to”  —   he hesitated to imagine the consequences  —   “build new buildings. ” There was, however, another option: just design,   and install in dispersed data centers a new kind of chip to make everything faster. These chips would be called T. P. U. s, or “tensor processing units,” and their value proposition  —   counterintuitively  —   is that they are deliberately less precise than normal chips. Rather than compute 12. 246 times 54. 392, they will give you the perfunctory answer to 12 times 54. On a mathematical level, rather than a metaphorical one, a neural network is just a structured series of hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of matrix multiplications carried out in succession, and it’s much more important that these processes be fast than that they be exact. “Normally,” Dean said, “  hardware is a bad idea. It usually works to speed up one thing. But because of the generality of neural networks, you can leverage this   hardware for a lot of other things. ” Just as the   process was nearly complete, Le and two colleagues finally demonstrated that neural networks might be configured to handle the structure of language. He drew upon an idea, called “word embeddings,” that had been around for more than 10 years. When you summarize images, you can divine a picture of what each stage of the summary looks like  —   an edge, a circle, etc. When you summarize language in a similar way, you essentially produce multidimensional maps of the distances, based on common usage, between one word and every single other word in the language. The machine is not “analyzing” the data the way that we might, with linguistic rules that identify some of them as nouns and others as verbs. Instead, it is shifting and twisting and warping the words around in the map. In two dimensions, you cannot make this map useful. You want, for example, “cat” to be in the rough vicinity of “dog,” but you also want “cat” to be near “tail” and near “supercilious” and near “meme,” because you want to try to capture all of the different relationships  —   both strong and weak  —   that the word “cat” has to other words. It can be related to all these other words simultaneously only if it is related to each of them in a different dimension. You can’t easily make a   map, but it turns out you can represent a language pretty well in a mere thousand or so dimensions  —   in other words, a universe in which each word is designated by a list of a thousand numbers. Le gave me a   hard time for my continual requests for a mental picture of these maps. “Gideon,” he would say, with the blunt regular demurral of Bartleby, “I do not generally like trying to visualize   vectors in   space. ” Still, certain dimensions in the space, it turned out, did seem to represent legible human categories, like gender or relative size. If you took the thousand numbers that meant “king” and literally just subtracted the thousand numbers that meant “queen,” you got the same numerical result as if you subtracted the numbers for “woman” from the numbers for “man. ” And if you took the entire space of the English language and the entire space of French, you could, at least in theory, train a network to learn how to take a sentence in one space and propose an equivalent in the other. You just had to give it millions and millions of English sentences as inputs on one side and their desired French outputs on the other, and over time it would recognize the relevant patterns in words the way that an image classifier recognized the relevant patterns in pixels. You could then give it a sentence in English and ask it to predict the best French analogue. The major difference between words and pixels, however, is that all of the pixels in an image are there at once, whereas words appear in a progression over time. You needed a way for the network to “hold in mind” the progression of a chronological sequence  —   the complete pathway from the first word to the last. In a period of about a week, in September 2014, three papers came out  —   one by Le and two others by academics in Canada and Germany  —   that at last provided all the theoretical tools necessary to do this sort of thing. That research allowed for   projects like Brain’s Magenta, an investigation into how machines might generate art and music. It also cleared the way toward an instrumental task like machine translation. Hinton told me he thought at the time that this   work would take at least five more years. Le’s paper showed that neural translation was plausible, but he had used only a relatively small public data set. (Small for Google, that is  —   it was actually the biggest public data set in the world. A decade of the old Translate had gathered production data that was between a hundred and a thousand times bigger.) More important, Le’s model didn’t work very well for sentences longer than about seven words. Mike Schuster, who then was a staff research scientist at Brain, picked up the baton. He knew that if Google didn’t find a way to scale these theoretical insights up to a production level, someone else would. The project took him the next two years. “You think,” Schuster says, “to translate something, you just get the data, run the experiments and you’re done, but it doesn’t work like that. ” Schuster is a taut, focused, ageless being with a tanned,   head, narrow shoulders, long camo cargo shorts tied below the knee and   Nike Flyknits. He looks as if he woke up in the lotus position, reached for his small, rimless, elliptical glasses, accepted calories in the form of a modest portion of preserved acorn and completed a relaxed desert decathlon on the way to the office in reality, he told me, it’s only an   bike ride each way. Schuster grew up in Duisburg, in the former West Germany’s   district, and studied electrical engineering before moving to Kyoto to work on early neural networks. In the 1990s, he ran experiments with a   machine as big as a conference room it cost millions of dollars and had to be trained for weeks to do something you could now do on your desktop in less than an hour. He published a paper in 1997 that was barely cited for a decade and a half this year it has been cited around 150 times. He is not humorless, but he does often wear an expression of some asperity, which I took as his signature combination of German restraint and Japanese restraint. The issues Schuster had to deal with were tangled. For one thing, Le’s code was   and it wasn’t compatible with the new     platform Google was then developing, TensorFlow. Dean directed to Schuster two other engineers, Yonghui Wu and Zhifeng Chen, in the fall of 2015. It took them two months just to replicate Le’s results on the new system. Le was around, but even he couldn’t always make heads or tails of what they had done. As Schuster put it, “Some of the stuff was not done in full consciousness. They didn’t know themselves why they worked. ” This February, Google’s research organization  —   the loose division of the company, roughly a thousand employees in all, dedicated to the   and the unclassifiable  —   convened their leads at an offsite retreat at the Westin St. Francis, on Union Square, a luxury hotel slightly less splendid than Google’s own San Francisco shop a mile or so to the east. The morning was reserved for rounds of “lightning talks,” quick updates to cover the research waterfront, and the afternoon was idled away in   “facilitated discussions. ” The hope was that the retreat might provide an occasion for the unpredictable, oblique, Bell   exchanges that kept a mature company prolific. At lunchtime, Corrado and Dean paired up in search of Macduff Hughes, director of Google Translate. Hughes was eating alone, and the two Brain members took positions at either side. As Corrado put it, “We ambushed him. ” “O. K.,” Corrado said to the wary Hughes, holding his breath for effect. “We have something to tell you. ” They told Hughes that 2016 seemed like a good time to consider an overhaul of Google Translate  —   the code of hundreds of engineers over 10 years  —   with a neural network. The old system worked the way all machine translation has worked for about 30 years: It sequestered each successive sentence fragment, looked up those words in a large statistically derived vocabulary table, then applied a battery of   rules to affix proper endings and rearrange it all to make sense. The approach is called “  statistical machine translation,” because by the time the system gets to the next phrase, it doesn’t know what the last one was. This is why Translate’s output sometimes looked like a shaken bag of fridge magnets. Brain’s replacement would, if it came together, read and render entire sentences at one draft. It would capture context  —   and something akin to meaning. The stakes may have seemed low: Translate generates minimal revenue, and it probably always will. For most Anglophone users, even a radical upgrade in the service’s performance would hardly be hailed as anything more than an expected incremental bump. But there was a case to be made that   machine translation is not only a   necessity but also a development very likely, in the long term, to prove transformational. In the immediate future, it’s vital to the company’s business strategy. Google estimates that 50 percent of the internet is in English, which perhaps 20 percent of the world’s population speaks. If Google was going to compete in China  —   where a majority of market share in   traffic belonged to its competitor Baidu  —   or India, decent machine translation would be an indispensable part of the infrastructure. Baidu itself had published a pathbreaking paper about the possibility of neural machine translation in July 2015. And in the more distant, speculative future, machine translation was perhaps the first step toward a general computational facility with human language. This would represent a major inflection point  —   perhaps the major inflection point  —   in the development of something that felt like true artificial intelligence. Most people in Silicon Valley were aware of machine learning as a   horizon, so Hughes had seen this ambush coming. He remained skeptical. A modest, sturdily built man of early middle age with mussed auburn hair graying at the temples, Hughes is a classic line engineer, the sort of craftsman who wouldn’t have been out of place at a drafting table at 1970s Boeing. His jeans pockets often look burdened with curious tools of ungainly dimension, as if he were porting around measuring tapes or thermocouples, and unlike many of the younger people who work for him, he has a wardrobe unreliant on company gear. He knew that various people in various places at Google and elsewhere had been trying to make neural translation work  —   not in a lab but at production scale  —   for years, to little avail. Hughes listened to their case and, at the end, said cautiously that it sounded to him as if maybe they could pull it off in three years. Dean thought otherwise. “We can do it by the end of the year, if we put our minds to it. ” One reason people liked and admired Dean so much was that he had a long record of successfully putting his mind to it. Another was that he wasn’t at all embarrassed to say sincere things like “if we put our minds to it. ” Hughes was sure the conversion wasn’t going to happen any time soon, but he didn’t personally care to be the reason. “Let’s prepare for 2016,” he went back and told his team. “I’m not going to be the one to say Jeff Dean can’t deliver speed. ” A month later, they were finally able to run a    experiment to compare Schuster’s new system with Hughes’s old one. Schuster wanted to run it for   but Hughes advised him to try something else. “” he said, “is so good that the improvement won’t be obvious. ” It was a challenge Schuster couldn’t resist. The benchmark metric to evaluate machine translation is called a BLEU score, which compares a machine translation with an average of many reliable human translations. At the time, the best BLEU scores for   were in the high 20s. An improvement of one point was considered very good an improvement of two was considered outstanding. The neural system, on the   language pair, showed an improvement over the old system of seven points. Hughes told Schuster’s team they hadn’t had even half as strong an improvement in their own system in the last four years. To be sure this wasn’t some fluke in the metric, they also turned to their pool of human contractors to do a    comparison. The   scores, in which sample sentences were graded from zero to six, showed an average improvement of 0. 4  —   roughly equivalent to the aggregate gains of the old system over its entire lifetime of development. In   Hughes sent his team an email. All projects on the old system were to be suspended immediately. Until then, the   team had been only three people  —   Schuster, Wu and Chen  —   but with Hughes’s support, the broader team began to coalesce. They met under Schuster’s command on Wednesdays at 2 p. m. in a corner room of the Brain building called Quartz Lake. The meeting was generally attended by a rotating cast of more than a dozen people. When Hughes or Corrado were there, they were usually the only native English speakers. The engineers spoke Chinese, Vietnamese, Polish, Russian, Arabic, German and Japanese, though they mostly spoke in their own efficient pidgin and in math. It is not always totally clear, at Google, who is running a meeting, but in Schuster’s case there was no ambiguity. The steps they needed to take, even then, were not wholly clear. “This story is a lot about uncertainty  —   uncertainty throughout the whole process,” Schuster told me at one point. “The software, the data, the hardware, the people. It was like”  —   he extended his long, gracile arms, slightly bent at the elbows, from his narrow shoulders  —   “swimming in a big sea of mud, and you can only see this far. ” He held out his hand eight inches in front of his chest. “There’s a goal somewhere, and maybe it’s there. ” Most of Google’s conference rooms have videochat monitors, which when idle display extremely   oversaturated public Google+ photos of a sylvan dreamscape or the northern lights or the Reichstag. Schuster gestured toward one of the panels, which showed a crystalline still of the Washington Monument at night. “The view from outside is that everyone has binoculars and can see ahead so far. ” The theoretical work to get them to this point had already been painstaking and   but the attempt to turn it into a viable product  —   the part that academic scientists might dismiss as “mere” engineering  —   was no less difficult. For one thing, they needed to make sure that they were training on good data. Google’s billions of words of training “reading” were mostly made up of complete sentences of moderate complexity, like the sort of thing you might find in Hemingway. Some of this is in the public domain: The original Rosetta Stone of statistical machine translation was millions of pages of the complete bilingual records of the Canadian Parliament. Much of it, however, was culled from 10 years of collected data, including human translations that were crowdsourced from enthusiastic respondents. The team had in their storehouse about 97 million unique English “words. ” But once they removed the emoticons, and the misspellings, and the redundancies, they had a working vocabulary of only around 160, 000. Then you had to refocus on what users actually wanted to translate, which frequently had very little to do with reasonable language as it is employed. Many people, Google had found, don’t look to the service to translate full, complex sentences they translate weird little shards of language. If you wanted the network to be able to handle the stream of user queries, you had to be sure to orient it in that direction. The network was very sensitive to the data it was trained on. As Hughes put it to me at one point: “The   system is learning everything it can. It’s like a toddler. ‘Oh, Daddy says that word when he’s mad! ’’u2009” He laughed. “You have to be careful. ” More than anything, though, they needed to make sure that the whole thing was fast and reliable enough that their users wouldn’t notice. In February, the translation of a   sentence took 10 seconds. They could never introduce anything that slow. The Translate team began to conduct latency experiments on a small percentage of users, in the form of faked delays, to identify tolerance. They found that a translation that took twice as long, or even five times as long, wouldn’t be registered. An eightfold slowdown would. They didn’t need to make sure this was true across all languages. In the case of a   language, like French or Chinese, they could countenance virtually no slowdown. For something more obscure, they knew that users wouldn’t be so scared off by a slight delay if they were getting better quality. They just wanted to prevent people from giving up and switching over to some competitor’s service. Schuster, for his part, admitted he just didn’t know if they ever could make it fast enough. He remembers a conversation in the microkitchen during which he turned to Chen and said, “There must be something we don’t know to make it fast enough, but I don’t know what it could be. ” He did know, though, that they needed more computers  —   “G. P. U. s,” graphics processors reconfigured for neural networks  —   for training. Hughes went to Schuster to ask what he thought. “Should we ask for a thousand G. P. U. s?” Schuster said, “Why not 2, 000?” Ten days later, they had the additional 2, 000 processors. By April, the original lineup of three had become more than 30 people  —   some of them, like Le, on the Brain side, and many from Translate. In May, Hughes assigned a kind of provisional owner to each language pair, and they all checked their results into a big shared spreadsheet of performance evaluations. At any given time, at least 20 people were running their own independent weeklong experiments and dealing with whatever unexpected problems came up. One day a model, for no apparent reason, started taking all the numbers it came across in a sentence and discarding them. There were months when it was all touch and go. “People were almost yelling,” Schuster said. By late spring, the various pieces were coming together. The team introduced something called a “  model,” a “coverage penalty,” “length normalization. ” Each part improved the results, Schuster says, by maybe a few percentage points, but in aggregate they had significant effects. Once the model was standardized, it would be only a single multilingual model that would improve over time, rather than the 150 different models that Translate currently used. Still, the paradox  —   that a tool built to further generalize, via learning machines, the process of automation required such an extraordinary amount of concerted human ingenuity and effort  —   was not lost on them. So much of what they did was just gut. How many neurons per layer did you use? 1, 024 or 512? How many layers? How many sentences did you run through at a time? How long did you train for? “We did hundreds of experiments,” Schuster told me, “until we knew that we could stop the training after one week. You’re always saying: When do we stop? How do I know I’m done? You never know you’re done. The   mechanism is never perfect. You need to train, and at some point you have to stop. That’s the very painful nature of this whole system. It’s hard for some people. It’s a little bit an art  —   where you put your brush to make it nice. It comes from just doing it. Some people are better, some worse. ” By May, the Brain team understood that the only way they were ever going to make the system fast enough to implement as a product was if they could run it on T. P. U. s, the   chips that Dean had called for. As Chen put it: “We did not even know if the code would work. But we did know that without T. P. U. s, it definitely wasn’t going to work. ” He remembers going to Dean one on one to plead, “Please reserve something for us. ” Dean had reserved them. The T. P. U. s, however, didn’t work right out of the box. Wu spent two months sitting next to someone from the hardware team in an attempt to figure out why. They weren’t just debugging the model they were debugging the chip. The   project would be proof of concept for the whole infrastructural investment. One Wednesday in June, the meeting in Quartz Lake began with murmurs about a Baidu paper that had recently appeared on the discipline’s chief online forum. Schuster brought the room to order. “Yes, Baidu came out with a paper. It feels like someone looking through our shoulder  —   similar architecture, similar results. ” The company’s BLEU scores were essentially what Google achieved in its internal tests in February and March. Le didn’t seem ruffled his conclusion seemed to be that it was a sign Google was on the right track. “It is very similar to our system,” he said with quiet approval. The Google team knew that they could have published their results earlier and perhaps beaten their competitors, but as Schuster put it: “Launching is more important than publishing. People say, ‘Oh, I did something first,’ but who cares, in the end?” This did, however, make it imperative that they get their own service out first and better. Hughes had a fantasy that they wouldn’t even inform their users of the switch. They would just wait and see if social media lit up with suspicions about the vast improvements. “We don’t want to say it’s a new system yet,” he told me at 5:36 p. m. two days after Labor Day, one minute before they rolled out    to 10 percent of their users, without telling anyone. “We want to make sure it works. The ideal is that it’s exploding on Twitter: ‘Have you seen how awesome Google Translate got? ’’u2009” The only two reliable measures of time in the seasonless Silicon Valley are the rotations of seasonal fruit in the microkitchens  —   from the pluots of midsummer to the Asian pears and Fuyu persimmons of early fall  —   and the zigzag of technological progress. On an almost uncomfortably warm Monday afternoon in late September, the team’s paper was at last released. It had an almost comical 31 authors. The next day, the members of Brain and Translate gathered to throw themselves a little celebratory reception in the Translate microkitchen. The rooms in the Brain building, perhaps in homage to the long winters of their diaspora, are named after Alaskan locales the Translate building’s theme is Hawaiian. The Hawaiian microkitchen has a slightly grainy beach photograph on one wall, a small     service counter with a stuffed parrot at the center and ceiling fixtures fitted to resemble paper lanterns. Two sparse histograms of bamboo poles line the sides, like the posts of an   tropical fort. Beyond the bamboo poles, glass walls and doors open onto rows of identical gray desks on either side. That morning had seen the arrival of new hooded sweatshirts to honor 10 years of Translate, and many team members went over to the party from their desks in their new gear. They were in part celebrating the fact that their decade of collective work was, as of that day, en route to retirement. At another institution, these new hoodies might thus have become a costume of bereavement, but the engineers and computer scientists from both teams all seemed pleased. Google’s neural translation was at last working. By the time of the party, the company’s   test had already processed 18 million queries. One engineer on the Translate team was running around with his phone out, trying to translate entire sentences from Chinese to English using Baidu’s alternative. He crowed with glee to anybody who would listen. “If you put in more than two characters at once, it times out!” (Baidu says this problem has never been reported by users.) When word began to spread, over the following weeks, that Google had introduced neural translation for Chinese to English, some people speculated that it was because that was the only language pair for which the company had decent results. Everybody at the party knew that the reality of their achievement would be clear in November. By then, however, many of them would be on to other projects. Hughes cleared his throat and stepped in front of the tiki bar. He wore a faded green polo with a rumpled collar, lightly patterned across the midsection with dark bands of drying sweat. There had been   problems, and then    problems, including a very big measurement error in the paper and a weird   bug in the system. But everything was resolved  —   or at least sufficiently resolved for the moment. The guests quieted. Hughes ran efficient and productive meetings, with a low tolerance for maundering or side conversation, but he was given pause by the gravity of the occasion. He acknowledged that he was, perhaps, stretching a metaphor, but it was important to him to underline the fact, he began, that the neural translation project itself represented a “collaboration between groups that spoke different languages. ” Their   project, he continued, represented a “step function forward”  —   that is, a discontinuous advance, a vertical leap rather than a smooth curve. The relevant translation had been not just between the two teams but from theory into reality. He raised a plastic   of   Champagne. “To communication,” he said, “and cooperation!” The engineers assembled looked around at one another and gave themselves over to little circumspect whoops and applause. Jeff Dean stood near the center of the microkitchen, his hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched slightly inward, with Corrado and Schuster. Dean saw that there was some diffuse preference that he contribute to the observance of the occasion, and he did so in a characteristically understated manner, with a light, rapid, concise addendum. What they had shown, Dean said, was that they could do two major things at once: “Do the research and get it in front of, I dunno, half a billion people. ” Everyone laughed, not because it was an exaggeration but because it wasn’t. Perhaps the most famous historic critique of artificial intelligence, or the claims made on its behalf, implicates the question of translation. The Chinese Room argument was proposed in 1980 by the Berkeley philosopher John Searle. In Searle’s thought experiment, a monolingual English speaker sits alone in a cell. An unseen jailer passes him, through a slot in the door, slips of paper marked with Chinese characters. The prisoner has been given a set of tables and rules in English for the composition of replies. He becomes so adept with these instructions that his answers are soon “absolutely indistinguishable from those of Chinese speakers. ” Should the unlucky prisoner be said to “understand” Chinese? Searle thought the answer was obviously not. This metaphor for a computer, Searle later wrote, exploded the claim that “the appropriately programmed digital computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the sense that human beings have minds. ” For the Google Brain team, though, or for nearly everyone else who works in machine learning in Silicon Valley, that view is entirely beside the point. This doesn’t mean they’re just ignoring the philosophical question. It means they have a fundamentally different view of the mind. Unlike Searle, they don’t assume that “consciousness” is some special, numinously glowing mental attribute  —   what the philosopher Gilbert Ryle called the “ghost in the machine. ” They just believe instead that the complex assortment of skills we call “consciousness” has randomly emerged from the coordinated activity of many different simple mechanisms. The implication is that our facility with what we consider the higher registers of thought are no different in kind from what we’re tempted to perceive as the lower registers. Logical reasoning, on this account, is seen as a lucky adaptation so is the ability to throw and catch a ball. Artificial intelligence is not about building a mind it’s about the improvement of tools to solve problems. As Corrado said to me on my very first day at Google, “It’s not about what a machine ‘knows’ or ‘understands’ but what it ‘does,’ and  —   more importantly  —   what it doesn’t do yet. ” Where you come down on “knowing” versus “doing” has real cultural and social implications. At the party, Schuster came over to me to express his frustration with the paper’s media reception. “Did you see the first press?” he asked me. He paraphrased a headline from that morning, blocking it word by word with his hand as he recited it: GOOGLE SAYS A. I. TRANSLATION IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM HUMANS’. Over the final weeks of the paper’s composition, the team had struggled with this Schuster often repeated that the message of the paper was “It’s much better than it was before, but not as good as humans. ” He had hoped it would be clear that their efforts weren’t about replacing people but helping them. And yet the rise of machine learning makes it more difficult for us to carve out a special place for us. If you believe, with Searle, that there is something special about human “insight,” you can draw a clear line that separates the human from the automated. If you agree with Searle’s antagonists, you can’t. It is understandable why so many people cling fast to the former view. At a 2015 M. I. T. conference about the roots of artificial intelligence, Noam Chomsky was asked what he thought of machine learning. He   the whole enterprise as mere statistical prediction, a glorified weather forecast. Even if neural translation attained perfect functionality, it would reveal nothing profound about the underlying nature of language. It could never tell you if a pronoun took the dative or the accusative case. This kind of prediction makes for a good tool to accomplish our ends, but it doesn’t succeed by the standards of furthering our understanding of why things happen the way they do. A machine can already detect tumors in medical scans better than human radiologists, but the machine can’t tell you what’s causing the cancer. Then again, can the radiologist? Medical diagnosis is one field most immediately, and perhaps unpredictably, threatened by machine learning. Radiologists are extensively trained and extremely well paid, and we think of their skill as one of professional insight  —   the highest register of thought. In the past year alone, researchers have shown not only that neural networks can find tumors in medical images much earlier than their human counterparts but also that machines can even make such diagnoses from the texts of pathology reports. What radiologists do turns out to be something much closer to predictive   than logical analysis. They’re not telling you what caused the cancer they’re just telling you it’s there. Once you’ve built a robust   apparatus for one purpose, it can be tweaked in the service of others. One Translate engineer took a network he put together to judge artwork and used it to drive an autonomous   car. A network built to recognize a cat can be turned around and trained on CT scans  —   and on infinitely more examples than even the best doctor could ever review. A neural network built to translate could work through millions of pages of documents of legal discovery in the tiniest fraction of the time it would take the most expensively credentialed lawyer. The kinds of jobs taken by automatons will no longer be just repetitive tasks that were once  —   unfairly, it ought to be emphasized  —   associated with the supposed lower intelligence of the uneducated classes. We’re not only talking about three and a half million truck drivers who may soon lack careers. We’re talking about inventory managers, economists, financial advisers, real estate agents. What Brain did over nine months is just one example of how quickly a small group at a large company can automate a task nobody ever would have associated with machines. The most important thing happening in Silicon Valley right now is not disruption. Rather, it’s    —   and the consolidation of power  —   on a scale and at a pace that are both probably unprecedented in human history. Brain has interns it has residents it has “ninja” classes to train people in other departments. Everywhere there are bins of free bike helmets, and free green umbrellas for the two days a year it rains, and little fruit salads, and nap pods, and shared treadmill desks, and massage chairs, and random cartons of   pastries, and places for   donations, and   climbing walls with scheduled instructors, and reading groups and policy talks and variegated support networks. The recipients of these major investments in human cultivation  —   for they’re far more than perks for proles in some digital salt mine  —   have at hand the power of complexly coordinated servers distributed across 13 data centers on four continents, data centers that draw enough electricity to light up large cities. But even enormous institutions like Google will be subject to this wave of automation once machines can learn from human speech, even the comfortable job of the programmer is threatened. As the party in the tiki bar was winding down, a Translate engineer brought over his laptop to show Hughes something. The screen swirled and pulsed with a vivid, kaleidoscopic animation of brightly colored spheres in long looping orbits that periodically collapsed into nebulae before dispersing once more. Hughes recognized what it was right away, but I had to look closely before I saw all the names  —   of people and files. It was an animation of the history of 10 years of changes to the Translate code base, every single buzzing and blooming contribution by every last team member. Hughes reached over gently to skip forward, from 2006 to 2008 to 2015, stopping every once in a while to pause and remember some distant campaign, some ancient triumph or catastrophe that now hurried by to be absorbed elsewhere or to burst on its own. Hughes pointed out how often Jeff Dean’s name expanded here and there in glowing spheres. Hughes called over Corrado, and they stood transfixed. To break the spell of melancholic nostalgia, Corrado, looking a little wounded, looked up and said, “So when do we get to delete it?” “Don’t worry about it,"” Hughes said. “The new code base is going to grow. Everything grows. ”"""
aid that didn’t negate the need to also regulate the participation of women with naturally high testosterone who may have an advantage. He offered an analogy: “Air pollution, like tobacco smoking, contributes to lung cancer, but one should never have to choose between these two before implementing prevention measures,” he wrote in an email. “As a governing body, I. A. A. F. has to do its best to ensure a level playing field. . .. These two topics are different but can lead to the same consequence, which is the impossibility for a dedi cated athlete to compete and succeed against an opponent who benefits from an unfair advantage. ” Last July, the Court of Arbitration for Sport issued its ruling in Dutee Chand’s case. The   panel concluded that although natural testosterone may play some role in athleticism, just what that role is, and how influential it is, remains unknown. As a result, the judges said that the I. A. A. F.’s policy was not justified by current scien tific research: “While the evidence indicates that higher levels of naturally occurring testosterone may increase athletic performance, the Panel is not satisfied that the degree of that advantage is more significant than the advantage derived from the numerous other variables which the parties acknowledge also affect female athletic performance: for example, nutrition, access to specialist training facilities and coaching and other genetic and biological variations. ” The judges concluded that requiring women like Chand to change their bodies in order to compete was unjustifiably discriminatory. The panel sus pended the policy until July 2017 to give the I. A. A. F. time to prove that the degree of competitive advantage conferred by naturally high testosterone in women was comparable to men’s advantage. If the I. A. A. F. doesn’t supply that evidence, the court said, the regulation “shall be declared void. ” It was the first time the court had ever overruled a   body’s entire policy. Chand was thrilled. “This wasn’t just about me,” she said, “but about all women like me, who come from difficult backgrounds. It is mostly people from poor backgrounds who come into running  —   people who know they will get food, housing, a job, if they run well. Richer people can pay their way to become doctors, engineers poor people don’t even know about their own medical challenges. ” Chand hoped that the ruling would prompt the I. O. C. to suspend its testosterone policy, too, so she would be eligible to try to qualify for the Rio Games. After all, the I. O. C. policy  —   which also called on national Olympic committees to “investigate any perceived deviation in sex characteristics”  —   was based on the same science that the court deemed inadequate. In November 2015, the I. O. C. established new parameters for dealing with gender. But it never actually addressed whether it would suspend its testosterone policy, as the I. A. A. F. was forced to do. That ambiguity left intersex athletes in limbo. Finally, in late February, the I. O. C. said it would not regulate women’s natural testosterone levels “until the issues of the case are resolved. ” It urged the I. A. A. F. to come up with the evidence by the court’s deadline so the suspended policy could be resurrected. It also said that to avoid discrimination,   women who are ineligible to compete against women should be eligible to compete against men. Advocates for intersex women were dismayed. “It’s ridiculous,” says Payoshni Mitra, the Indian researcher. “They say the policy is not for testing gender  —   but saying that a hyperandrogenic woman can compete as a man, not a woman, inherently means they think she really is a man, not a woman. It brings back the debate around an athlete’s gender, publicly humiliating her in the process. ” Emmanuelle Moreau, head of media relations for the I. O. C. disagreed, writing in an email, “It is a question of eligibility, not gender or (biological) sex. ” A separate section of the I. O. C. gender guidelines addressed a different group of atypical women (and atypical men): transgender athletes. Unlike the intersex section, the transgender section stresses the importance of human rights, nondiscrimination and inclusion. It eschews most of the I. O. C. ’s former requirements, including that trans competitors have their ovaries or testicles removed and undergo surgery so their external genitalia matches their gender identity. In the new guidelines,    athletes face no restrictions of any kind    athletes have some restrictions, including suppressing their testosterone levels below the typi cal male range. And once they’ve declared their gender as female, they can’t change it again for four years if they want to compete in sports. Reactions among trans advocates ran the gamut. Many trans advocates viewed the liberalized regulations as a victory. But some trans women athletes who long ago had their testicles removed (and as a result, make virtually no testosterone) were unhappy with the policy they argued that lifting the surgery requirement gave transwomen who still had   testicles an unfair advantage over trans women who didn’t. And still other advocates said that requiring transwomen to suppress their testosterone below 10 nanomoles is premised on the very same claim about testosterone that the court rejected  —   that naturally made testosterone is the primary cause of men’s competitive advantage over women. Without evidence that “male range” testosterone levels really do provide that advantage, some say it’s premature to base a policy on speculation  —   especially one that requires people to transform their bodies. In May, the Canadian Center for Ethics in Sports, which manages the country’s antidoping program and recommends ethics standards, issued   guidelines for all Canadian sports organizations. The statement says policies that regulate eligibility, like those related to hormones, should be backed by defensible science. It adds, “There is simply not the evidence to suggest whether, or to what degree, hormone levels consistently confer competitive advantage. ” And yet it’s hard to imagine that many female athletes would easily accept the idea of competing against transwomen athletes without those regulations in place. Those debates are far from Chand’s thoughts. Her focus now is on making the most of the window the ruling provides: allowing her to try to qualify for next month’s Olympics without having to change her body. In the miserable months after her test results were revealed, Chand’s training time and concentration were interrupted, and her hope of ever competing seemed out of reach. Once the ruling was issued, though, she returned to the Indian national team, and intensified her training for the 100 meters, the 200 meters and the   relay. In addition to working out six hours a day, she tries to relax with naps and Facebook. She has made frequent trips to nations holding qualifying competitions. In May, she competed in India, China and Taiwan in June, in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. She has until July 11 to meet the I. O. C. time requirement. She is painfully aware that if she doesn’t make this summer’s Olympics, she may not have an  other chance. The I. A. A. F. may still come up with evidence that satisfies the court and would exclude women like her from competing without altering their bodies. Chand’s best shot to qualify for Rio is in the 100 meters, which she must complete in 11. 32 seconds or less. She remains   of a second short. Note: On June 25, Dutee Chand qualified for the Rio Olympics, running the 100 meters in 11. 30 seconds in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and breaking a national record for India. Later that day," she posted an even faster time of 11. 24 seconds.

ole of intermediary but beyond the point of choosing, I conveyed these concerns to Close at various times. His reactions ran from sadness to irritation. “You see, I can’t say I’m happier than I’ve ever been in my life without saying that my relationship with their mother did not make me happy or my children did not make me happy,” he told me one afternoon. “You would think that by now they would just want me to be happy. ” “The challenge for me,” I responded, “is to write about these things without overstepping boundaries. ” “Yeah,” he said quietly. “Because I don’t want to paint some phony caricature of you, either. ” Close let out a sigh. “Well, I think you can say that I’ve loved being a father,” he said. “Nothing matters to me more than my children. ” I want to tell you that as he said these words, it was obvious that he meant them, even if they seemed to contradict the sentiment just before. As summer turned into fall, then winter and spring, I found myself gripped by uncertainty about the whole project of writing about Close in a period of such turmoil. He was producing startling new work that I wanted to understand, but it seemed to emerge from a spirit of liberation that left a path of devastation behind. I could not help wondering whether it was right, or fair, or even possible to convey in words the man that Close was becoming, and I also wondered, in a more practical sense, how to write about a person in the midst of transmogrifying flux  —   what of any certainty could be noted, what insight might be made? It occurs to me now that what this comes down to is the nature of portraiture itself. Writing and painting, descriptive undertakings both, rise and fall on the same ground. The basic mistake of either is to orchestrate too much. If the great insight of Close’s work has been to make portraiture vivid by removing detail, forcing viewers to contribute their own perception to the process, what I have noticed as a reader and writer is that a similar principle applies. The best you can do is provide a constellation of individual points, just enough to let the reader form an opinion of her own. This can be challenging when the writer has something certain in mind to say, but it becomes all the more difficult when there is nothing certain to say at all. A written portrait of a portrait painter is recursive from the start, but when you’re trying to get a fix on the identity of an identity fixer whose own identity is coming unfixed, the whole thing goes uroboric. So, you work with what you have. You mix one color at a time. You think about Close as a child in the timbering Pacific Northwest, a dyslexic kid in a fragile body searching for a way up and out. You find an old photograph of him standing outside his parents’ clapboard home, dressed to perform magic in a towering top hat, an ascot tossed around his neck, one leg cast across the other in calculated nonchalance, as he leans just so on the thick end of a pool cue with his   boots cupped like armor around his feeble legs. You think about how he would perform a trick, then reveal the illusion to his audience  —   and then perform the trick again, confident that the perception of viewers would enhance the show. You think about his father’s death at 48, the same age his own medical calamity struck, and how his mother went off to work, leaving him to sit with his grandmother before the    television set, watching the   McCarthy hearings while she knitted   stars and sewed them together into a tablecloth or a blanket, these rows and columns of individual elements that merge together in a single work. And from these fragments of what you’ve seen and heard, the details you glean from his past, you hope that like one of his vast grid paintings, something will cohere, that within the noise and contrasting elements, a portrait of Chuck Close will rise. On my last visit to Long Beach, Close and I wandered into his studio for a look at his latest   portrait. As we entered the room, I felt something jump in my throat and heard myself whisper, “My god. ” The painting, which you can see below, was six feet high and rendered in dusky, ominous tones, with one side of his face dissolving into darkness. It was as if, after months of struggling to present himself in sensational color, he was finally settling into a quiet peace with the twilight of his life. I mean to say, there was nothing gloomy about the painting, nothing tragic or diminished or broken, but it was freighted with the necessary weight of time, emanating the unknown. I had seen the painting once before, six months earlier, when he was beginning it. He had just arrived in Miami from New York, and I was stuck on a layover at the airport, so I decided to slip out of the terminal for a quick glass of whiskey at his apartment. The sky was heavy with incipient rain, giving the city a wounded air, and we sat beside a bank of windows overlooking the ocean. At the time, the canvas that would become his new painting was mounted on the easel, entirely blank except for a few horizontal streaks of pink and blue. Without much thought, I asked, “How is the painting going?” and a strange look washed over his face. He turned to stare out the window for a moment, then said in a low and raspy voice: “I’ve never had an artist’s block before. If I just get to work, it’ll happen. But I worked on a painting in Long Beach after my last show, and I sat there so confused. I didn’t have any idea what I was doing. So I quit that painting and backed up, and hoped a change of venue would make it happen. ” “Could you be happy if the block doesn’t go away?” I asked. “I wouldn’t want to,” he said. Six months later, he was back in Long Beach with the canvas nearly complete. It was the darkest painting he’d ever composed and, to my eye, one of the most beautiful. “I was talking to Paul Simon yesterday,” he said. “Did you see the piece in The Times that he’s going to retire?” Three weeks earlier, Simon had released a new album, “Stranger to Stranger,” with its cover taken from a portrait that Close painted of the musician a few years back. Then, the day before I saw Close, Simon announced that the album would be his last. “I called him up, and I said, ‘Artists don’t retire,’’u2009” Close told me. “I think I talked him out of it. I said: ‘Don’t deny yourself this late stage, because the late stage can be very interesting. You know everybody hated late de Kooning, but it turned out to be great stuff. Late Picasso, nobody liked it, and it turned out to be great. ’’u2009” Close reminded Simon that Matisse was unable to continue painting late in life. “Had Matisse not done the cutouts, we would not know who he was,” Close said. “Paul said, ‘I don’t have any ideas.’ I said: ‘Well, of course you don’t have any ideas. Sitting around waiting for an idea is the worst thing you can do. All ideas come out of the work itself. ’’u2009” He pointed out that Simon is 74, the same age he was early last summer. “I told him, ‘When you get to be my age, you’ll see,’’u2009” he said with a laugh. As he spoke, I became acutely aware of how much it has meant for Close to continue working this past year, to force himself through the block, to confront the canvas anew each day. He had cleared the gantlet and emerged with a painting that seems to me a masterwork, but the glowering threat of time remained and was unlikely ever to relent. I remembered how I had left him that day in Miami, as it grew late and I had to return to the airport. I was packing my things and glanced at the new canvas one last time on my way out the door. The sprawling white emptiness suddenly felt overwhelming, the horizontal streaks of pink and blue insufficient, and I stood there for a moment, wondering where he would take it, whether he would ever complete the painting, or if, as in his deepest fears, he had already finished his final work. The line of pink squares looked to me then like the knuckles on an accusatory finger, pointing through the window to the skein of clouds gathering over a dark," unruly ocean.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nyack’s force, was the other policeman killed. Frank Olivier, raised in a Nyack housing project and now a corrections officer at the Rockland County jail, recalled growing up under Brown’s watch. “We were his kids,” Olivier said. “He would make sure we were doing our homework, he would come to our track meets. With Officer Brown, you knew you had a chance. ” When he and his friends heard Brown was killed, “everybody was in a rage,” he said. But Olivier now feels differently about Judith Clark. He wrote one of the letters that Bennett delivered to the governor. “I know that people change after a while. Communities heal after a while. This lady has been in there 30 years. When has she paid her debt?” In December 2010, a few days before Governor Paterson’s term ended, he met with a small delegation of Clark’s supporters led by Bennett and Dennison. He told them that his staff advised against her release and that he was in agreement. Paterson wouldn’t talk to me about it, but he recently told Jim Dwyer, a Times columnist, that he feared being “tarred and feathered” if he released Clark. Last June, I went to meet some of the people whose wrath the governor feared at a   breakfast in Nyack for a scholarship fund in memory of officers Brown and O’Grady. Most were still bitter over Boudin’s release and felt that Clark deserved to remain in prison. Did they believe such criminals could be rehabilitated? “I know, they’re all wonderful,” Bill Ryan, a former New York City Police lieutenant who lives nearby, responded sarcastically. “They’re teaching little children and working with the handicapped and unwed mothers. ” His remarks brought knowing smiles around the table. It’s a skepticism shared by many. When I first started visiting Clark, I also wondered whether her transformation was a calculated effort to get out of prison. Over time I’ve come to see her differently. A dozen former inmates told me stories of how Clark helped them sort out their own troubles while they served time with her. Sheila Ryan, a former N. Y. P. D. investigator who spent 10 years at Bedford for killing the man she claimed raped her, told me that when she first met Clark in prison in the 1980s, she wanted nothing to do with her. “I thought, My God, you’re responsible for killing cops, and here you are laughing?” But she has changed her mind. “She is truly remorseful and sorry for what happened,” she said. As Elaine Lord, the former Bedford Hills superintendent told me, prisons should rehabilitate, not just warehouse. And Clark is a model for what’s possible in prison. “She is not the person who was involved in that crime,” Lord said. “She’s a different person. We have a right to be angry at them, but it doesn’t change anything. There has to be an end. ” Not long ago, Clark spoke at a Bedford Hills event. Her theme was the Book of Jonah. Like Jonah, she told the audience, she had spent years in   behavior and had been cast overboard into a   sea for her actions. Like Jonah, she found rescue in the belly of the whale, in her case behind bars. “In prison,” she said," “I learned who I was. ”""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ear was the degree to which the Afghanistan debate was dominated by military considerations. While Clinton did raise the need to deal with Afghanistan’s neighbor, Pakistan, her reflexive support of Gates, Petraeus and McChrystal meant she was not a powerful voice for diplomatic alternatives. “She contributed to the overmilitarizing of the analysis of the problem,” says Sarah Chayes, who was an adviser to McChrystal and later to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen. In October 2015, the persistent violence in Afghanistan and the legacy of Karzai’s misrule forced Obama to reverse his plan to withdraw the last American soldiers by the end of his presi dency. A few thousand troops will stay there indefinitely. And for all of Clinton’s talk about a civilian surge, it never really materialized. For Clinton, the Afghanistan episode laid bare a vexed relationship between her and Eikenberry, one of the few generals with whom she didn’t hit it off. A   with graduate degrees from Harvard and Stanford, Eikenberry was brilliant but had a reputation among his colleagues for being imperious. Clinton had a similarly chilly relationship with Douglas Lute, another Army lieutenant general with a graduate degree from Harvard, who also fought with Holbrooke. “She likes the    —   McChrystal, Petraeus, Keane,” one of her aides observes. “Real military guys, not these retired   who go into civilian jobs. ” “There’s no doubt that Hillary Clinton’s more muscular brand of American foreign policy is better matched to 2016 than it was to 2008,” said Jake Sullivan, her top policy adviser at the State Department, who plays the same role in her campaign. It was De cem ber 2015, 53 days before the Iowa caucuses, and Sullivan was sitting down with me in Clinton’s sprawling Brooklyn headquarters to explain how she was shaping her message for a campaign suddenly dominated by concerns about national security. Clinton’s strategy, he said, was twofold: Explain to voters that she had a clear plan for confronting the threat posed by Islamic terrorism, and expose her Republican opponents as utterly lacking in experience or credibility on national security. There were good reasons for Clinton to let her inner hawk fly. After the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. Americans’ concern about a major attack on the nation spiked. A   poll taken after Paris showed that a majority, 53 percent, favored sending ground troops to Iraq or Syria, a remarkable shift from the   sentiment that prevailed during most of Obama’s presidency. The Republican candidates were reaching for apocalyptic metaphors to demonstrate their resolve. Ted Cruz threatened to   the Islamic State to test whether desert sand can glow Donald Trump called for the United States to ban all Muslims from entering the country “until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses. ” Yet such spikes in the public appetite for mili tary action tend to be transitory. Three weeks later, the same poll showed an even split, at 49 percent, on whether to deploy troops. Neither Trump nor Cruz favors major new deployments of American soldiers to Iraq and Syria (nor, for that matter, does Clinton). If anything, both are more skeptical than Clinton about intervention and more circumspect than she about maintaining the nation’s   War II military commitments. Trump loudly proclaims his opposition to the Iraq War. He wants the United States to spend less to underwrite NATO and has talked about withdrawing the American security umbrella from Asia, even if that means Japan and South Korea would acquire nuclear weapons to defend themselves. Cruz, unlike Clinton, opposed aiding the Syrian rebels in 2014. He once supported Pentagon budget constraints advocated by his isolationist colleague, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Thus might the gen eral election present voters with an unfamiliar choice: a Democratic hawk versus a Republican reluctant warrior. To thwart the progressive insurgency of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton carefully calibrated her message during the Democratic primaries to align herself closely with Barack Obama and his racially diverse coalition. But as she pivots to the general election, that balancing act with Obama will become trickier. “There’s going to be a huge amount of interest in the press to ” Sullivan says. “It just so easily can become a sport that distracts from her ability to make an affirmative case. ” In showing her stripes as a prospective commander in chief, Clinton will no doubt draw heavily upon her State Department experience  —   filtering the lessons she learned in Libya, Syria and Iraq into the sinewy worldview she has held since childhood. Last fall, in a series of policy speeches, Clinton began limning distinctions with the president on national security. She said the United States should consider sending more   troops to Iraq than Obama had committed, to help the Iraqis and Kurds fight the Islamic State. She came out in favor of a partial   zone over Syria. And she described the threat posed by ISIS to Americans in starker terms than he did. As is often the case with Clinton and Obama, the differences were less about direction than degree. She wasn’t calling for ground troops in the Middle East, any more than he was. Clinton insisted her plan was not a break with his, merely an “intensification and acceleration” of it. It’s an open question how well Clinton’s hawkish instincts match the country’s mood. Americans are weary of war and remain suspicious of foreign entanglements. And yet, after the retrenchment of the Obama years, there is polling evidence that they are equally dissatisfied with a portrait of their country as a spent force, managing its decline amid a world of rising powers like China, resurgent empires like Vladimir Putin’s Russia and lethal new forces like the Islamic State. If Obama’s minimalist approach was a necessary reaction to the maximalist style of his predecessor, then perhaps what Americans yearn for is something in between  —   the kind of   pragmatism that Clinton has spent a lifetime honing. “The president has made some tough decisions,” says Leon Panetta, who served as Obama’s defense secretary after Bob Gates, and as director of the C. I. A. before David Petraeus. “But it’s been a mixed record, and the concern is, the president defining what America’s role in the world is in the 21st century hasn’t happened. “Hopefully, he’ll do it,” he added, acknowledging the time Obama has left. “Certainly," she would. ”""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id, grinning, offering his hands for  . “Put ’em up for our immigrants!” “Vote no, Senator,” someone yelled. “Vote no!” “I’m no on DeVos,” Schumer said. “No on Tillerson. No on Mulvaney. No on Carson. No on Mnuchin. No on all of them!” (He had, in fact, already announced he was voting against Betsy DeVos, Rex Tillerson and Mick Mulvaney  —   the prospective secretaries of education and state and head of the Office of Management and Budget, respectively.) “Why did you confirm Haley and Mattis?” someone demanded. “Grow a spine, Chuck!” a   trimly mustachioed man screamed, practically in Schumer’s ear, his voice cracking: “Grow a spiiiiiiiine!” A scruffy young man, perched in the crook of a tree, began leading a chant: “Grow a spine, Chuck! You must obstruct!” Schumer is one of those politicians who seem to feed on the attention of a crowd, even a largely hostile one, and he pressed on gamely, smiling and shaking hands, pointing in the direction of the occasional familiar face: “Hey Dave, nice to see you!” He was almost out to the street, the crowd around him thinning, when a   woman in a “pussy hat” called out, in a Brooklyn accent nearly as thick as Schumer’s, “What about the first four votes?” Schumer stopped, a hint of a smile on his face, as if intrigued by the specificity of the harangue. “Would you have voted against Mattis?” he asked. “Everything they do. ” “He’s the only one who came out against torture. ” “So it’s a defensive vote?” “Yeah. ” “So we’re going to keep figuring out who’s a relief?” “No, no, no  —   all the other bad ones, we’re going against. ” He swept off up the block with his aides, a man trying to figure out how to be reasonable in deeply unreasonable times. The next cabinet vote, as it happened, was for DeVos, a nominee whom Democrats considered as vulnerable as she was objectionable. In   Schumer wrote to McConnell demanding that certain conditions be met  —   only two cabinet votes a week, and all background checks by the Office of Government Ethics completed before the confirmation hearings  —   or else he would lead his caucus in opposing eight of the nominees, including DeVos. Two Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, had announced their opposition to DeVos. One more no vote would sink the nomination. The Democrats called for an   marathon debate of DeVos’s nomination leading up to the vote on Feb. 7. It wasn’t a filibuster  —   Reid had done away with those for cabinet nominees in 2013  —   but a kind of  : an effort to draw attention to the vote in hopes of further overloading the Senate office buildings’ phone lines and nudging off the fence one of several Republican senators who had been identified, perhaps wishfully, as potentially persuadable. It was also an unsubtle challenge to Senate Democrats: the first moment since the airport protests for the party to stand up and stand together. As they held the floor Monday night and through the early hours of Tuesday, the senators stood in front of the   cameras and read off messages from constituents, urging them to send more to their Republican colleagues before the noon vote. By Monday evening the hashtag #HoldTheFloor was trending on Twitter, accompanied by emoji of praying hands, by inspirational quotes, by photos of Nelson Mandela or of Hodor from “Game of Thrones. ” It was odd, amid the online clamor, to arrive at the Capitol shortly before 2 a. m. and find it   quiet, nearly empty. The Democratic senators filed in one at a time, spoke for an hour to the rotating crew of stenographers and left. Brian Schatz, a young senator from Hawaii, was waiting for his turn to speak and checking Twitter on his phone. He had voted for the first four nominees but then loudly declaimed against others. Shortly after the travel ban, he tweeted: “I’ve never been a     guy. But I do think it’s time to march on the street. ” After an hour, the camera cut away, and a mildly   Tim Kaine ambled onto the floor to take his turn. “Timmy!” Schatz exclaimed. “Are you going to speak for, like, an hour without notes?” Kaine grinned. “I’ve got three pages,” he said. The Senate chamber has the oxygenated,   atmosphere of a casino on a slow night, the same woozy contextlessness. Sitting in the   press gallery as the clock inched toward 4 a. m. I began to have the strange sensation of not knowing exactly what I was watching. The Democrats, it was clear by then, would lose this fight. But the point of the fight was to show that they would fight, to generate the affirming images and video clips that were cascading through   social media, demonstrations of the efficacy of a resistance whose   prospects rested largely on the impression that Democratic lawmakers were hearing, and responding to, its demands. “Fourteen Democrats voted for Mike Pompeo,” Ezra Levin, the Indivisible Guide   told me. “This was a man who slandered Muslims, was open to torture, and 14 Democrats voted for him! That’s why you saw people outside Dianne Feinstein’s office, outside of Schumer’s office, Amy Klobuchar’s office. The base wants them to stand on principle. In the two weeks between Pompeo and DeVos, there were massive protests. And zero Democrats voted for DeVos. Pompeo was an awful pick DeVos was an awful pick. The thing that changed was not the degree of their awfulness, it was that people stood up. ” The next day, at a confirmation hearing for Jeff Sessions, Elizabeth Warren read from a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing his judicial appointment, prompting McConnell to censure her with an obscure procedural rule. McConnell’s justification  —   “She was warned she was given an explanation nevertheless, she persisted”  —   quickly evolved into a rallying cry, prompting nearly twice as many Google searches for Warren’s name as her election to the Senate did in 2012. In the next 24 hours, members of the   organization MoveOn raised $300, 000 for her 2018   campaign, and Sessions was confirmed as the attorney general of the United States. Who could claim this as a victory? Trump? Warren? Both of them? By   spirits in Democratic Washington had palpably lifted. You wouldn’t have described the mood as triumphal it was more as if everyone had emerged from the basement after a tornado to discover that, while the car was upside down somewhere, at least the house was still standing. The travel ban remained marooned, at least temporarily, in the courts. (A redrafted executive order was issued on March 6, but it was unclear if it had fully resolved the legal issues of the first.) Trump’s nominee for labor secretary, the   C. E. O. Andrew Puzder, backed out of consideration for the job in   after the Republicans concluded that they did not have the votes to confirm him. The project of doing away with the Affordable Care Act was still tied up in committee amid disagreements among the Republicans themselves  —   an inevitable consequence, perhaps, of their      opposition effort that the Democrats were now studying. And the infrastructure bill that had threatened to divide Democrats against themselves never materialized there was talk now of it being pushed back to 2018. On Feb. 28, a few hours before Trump was due to give his first speech to Congress, I went to see Schumer in the minority leader’s chambers in the Capitol. The senator was sitting in a leather wingback chair in his shirt sleeves, and he seemed to be in a genuinely upbeat mood. “Things look much better for us and much worse for him than I ever imagined based on the first month,” he told me. The day before, three Republican senators  —   Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Rand Paul  —   had held out for nothing less than full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. “That’s the three votes they need, even with 52!” Schumer crowed. (The following week, a replacement bill finally began to advance through committees in the House of Representatives, but Paul declared in a Fox News interview that it would be “dead on arrival” in the Senate.) He pointed to the crowds that Indivisible and other groups had turned out in the thousands at town halls across the country the previous week. “Trump is the enemy, and his Republican acolytes  —   not Democrats,” he said. “We’re already beginning to coalesce around that. It was very positive. They throw a few brickbats, fine. This energy is enormous. ” But even as a sort of guarded optimism set in among many Democrats, there was a gloom among the party’s left flank that appeared nearly as thick as it was in November  —   a sense that the party, buoyed by the easy gratification of opposition, was punting on resolving difficult questions, at its own peril. Just before visiting Schumer, I went to see Bernie Sanders in his Capitol Hill office. In a couple of hours, the Vermont senator’s colleagues would be gathering in Senate dining room to share a meal  —   a bipartisan tradition before presidential speeches to Congress. But Sanders did not intend to be among them. “I think I’m going to skip the dinner tonight,” he said. “I’m not in a very convivial mood. I don’t want to pretend. These are very, to my mind, frightening times. ” Since ending his presidential campaign in July, Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate, had been managing the complicated task of redirecting the movement that materialized around his candidacy toward a Democratic Party with which he had a tetchy relationship. Schumer had created a post for him in the party’s Senate leadership, and Sanders had helped mobilize his   network for two rounds of rallies in defense of the Affordable Care Act. But earlier in the week, he said in a CNN interview that “a total transformation of the Democratic Party” was still in order, and that he had also not yet given the D. N. C.  —   which he called the “establishment’s house”  —   access to his campaign email list. “It’s not some magical system,” Sanders told me, disdain dripping off the word “magical. ” “How do we bring in, how do you raise money from, those people? You know what? You’ve got to stand for something. ” I asked him if he thought the Democratic Party knew what it stood for. “You’re asking a good question, and I can’t give you a definitive answer,” he said. “Certainly there are some people in the Democratic Party who want to maintain the status quo. They would rather go down with the Titanic so long as they have   seats. ” In early February, Elizabeth Warren, in a speech to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, warned that while the Democrats were fashioning themselves into an opposition party, that was not enough to solve the problems that put them in the position of becoming an opposition party in the first place. “Men like Donald Trump come to power when their countries are already in deep trouble,” she said. “There are some in the Democratic Party who urge caution. They say this is a tactical problem: ‘We need better data. We need better social media. We need better outreach. We need better talking points.’ Better talking points? Are you kidding me? People were so desperate for economic change in this country that Donald Trump was just inaugurated as president, and people think we need better talking points? What alternative planet are they living on?” When I met Warren a few weeks later, I asked her about the speech, and whether the postelection unity that Trump provided the Democratic Party made her ambitions to reform it easier or harder to realize. “I think it has reminded Democrats we need to run on our values,” she replied, parrying the question. “Because our values are more in line with most of America. ” If you squinted at the bodies packing the streets and the town halls, though, the picture looked an awful lot like the recent past: Here were people drawn together in defense of liberal immigration and refugee policies, reproductive rights, civil liberties and preserving Obama’s policy legacy, and in opposition to a president who was moving against all those things. These were last year’s arguments, only louder. If Trump, as president, seemed unable to let go of his 2016 campaign, the Democrats seemed like they were acting out an improved version of their own  —   the crowds bigger and more unified, the stakes more clearly understood. “There’s more enthusiasm, more energy, more passion now than there was at any point in the 2016 campaign  —   which is both heartening and discouraging, all at the same time,” Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, the largest Democratic super PAC, told me. “’u200bI think that’s what a lot of us are seeing and feeling. And we’re trying to figure out the right way for us to respond to it. ” For now, the question was how far “No” could carry the Democrats. The Indivisible Guide, in the three months since Levin first posted the Google Doc, had birthed the organization he and his colleagues had not intended to start, with Levin as the executive director. It had registered more than 5, 800 local affiliate groups, at least two in each of the country’s 435 congressional districts. In February, Priorities USA, which raised $192 million to support Clinton in 2016, announced it was reorienting itself to support   organizing  —   including an investment in online advertising driving people to the Indivisible Guide’s website listing congressional members’ town halls. Schumer, meanwhile, was planning to lead the Democrats against Neil Gorsuch’s Supreme Court nomination, forcing the Republicans to find 60 votes or get rid of the filibuster. If Republicans tried to gut federal funding for Planned Parenthood in a forthcoming budget bill, he told me, he was perfectly willing to filibuster that too. “I think McConnell and Ryan know they can’t shut down the government,” he said. “Because they’re in charge now. ” And Schumer, precisely no one’s idea of a revolutionary, was now, at least in a narrow constitutional sense, the leader of the resistance. On my way out of his new office, I noticed a green marble fireplace and asked him if he’d used it yet. “Oh, man,"” he said. “It’s my favorite perk. I live in Brooklyn  —   I never had a fireplace. I’m learning to start fires. ”""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

48002,67292,"’Training doesn’t stop harassment’: After a stunning string of blows, experts weigh in on how Uber can recover",Business Insider,Áine Cain,6/8/2017,2017,6,,"’’ ’In February, Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, published a damning blog post alleging .’ ’She described her ”strange experience” at the   startup, which allegedly involved HR ignoring her complaints that her manager was sexually harassing her.’ ”That was just the start of Uber’s woes.” ’ the startup was hit with further accusations of harassment, as a  report alleged groping and drug use among employees at a company retreat. The stream of bad news may have prompted  including SVP Amit Singhal, who had not disclosed sexual harassment complaints against him from his previous job at Google.’ ”As a result of the allegations, Uber launched an internal work misconduct investigation and has enlisted outside law firm Perkins Coie to investigate as well. In addition, US Attorney General Eric Holder is leading a separate investigation specifically focusing on investigating sexual harassment, reporting back to the company’s board.” ’So far, 215 claims of various inappropriate workplace incidents including sexual harassment have been investigated, . On Tuesday, Uber fired 20 employees as a result of the investigation and .’ ’ ’t’t’  And here’s a further breakdown of the 215 claims:  ’ ’But is it enough to fix a culture that led to repeated allegations of harassment?’ ’”I like the idea that people and organizations can be rehabilitated,” says Raleigh, North    Laurie Ruettimann. ”I’’m not sure I’’ve seen that in practice in recent history, but I have to believe it’’s true. ”’ ”Business Insider spoke with three HR experts to find out the implications of the allegations and resulting investigations for Uber and how the world’s most valuable startup might correct its course going forward. ” ’The HR experts agreed that such a crisis is indicative of  in which harassment and other bad behavior can flourish.’ ’”Obviously the culture permitted it and allowed it to happen,” says  and  president Dr. N. Elizabeth Fried. ”One would hope that the culture comes out of an evolved level of thinking, but . .. if they were truly a culture that was committed to fairness and equality and that type of situation, they wouldn’’t be in the position that they’’re in. ”’ ’In other words, in order to permanently fix the problem going forward, the entire culture must change.’ ’John Hudson, a   HR business partner with  says that Uber firing employees as a result of the investigation is ”a smart PR move. ”’ ’”If there is an alleged culture of harassment there, this is a first step,” he says. ”They then need to continue to build on cleaning up the environment and change their hiring practices. ”’ ’”If they are truly serious about changing the culture, then cleaning house is necessary,” Hudson says. ”Have they identified where the issues are? A lot of these culture problems start at the top of an organization. Were they bold enough to make some moves of some bad apples regardless of their performance? Or did they look the other way at some of the talent? ”’ ’ the harassment allegations have proven ”a problem Uber has been slow to recognize. ”’ ”Recommendations from the investigation’s official report are expected to be announced next week, after Uber’s staff meeting. The experts had some suggestions on what policies may actually help combat harassment.” ’”If there was not a formal investigative process or way for employee complaints to be investigated, a good first step would be to implement one,” Hudson says. To do this, he suggests a few things:’ ’An Uber spokesperson has said that the company does have a confidential help line, which it will continue to run, as well as a new system in place to better log and track complaints.’ ’Ruettimann says that the company needs to look closely at its hiring process to understand ”what it can do to create better talent pools. ”’ ’”Recruit better, hire better, fire faster,” she says.’ ’”What seems weird is that they haven’’t hired a   HR professional to help them clean house,” Ruettimann says. ”Maybe they don’’t have any faith in the HR profession. Maybe they don’’t know anybody who can help them in the trenches. But from developing a diverse talent pool to managing performance, Uber could really use a fresh take on human resources. ”’ ”An Uber spokesperson told Business Insider that the company’s global employee relations team has doubled .” ’Uber announced that, in addition to the 20 terminations, 31 employees are in training and seven have received final warnings about their behavior. In addition to sexual harassment, Perkins Coie investigated claims of unprofessional behavior, bullying, retaliation, physical security, wrongful termination, and other forms of harassment. No action was taken regarding 100 of those claims, and 57 are still under review, .’ ’Fried advocates for   training on harassment, specifically breaking down how to identify, report, and investigate harassing behavior. She says that  is not a good excuse.’ ’”If you keep a blind eye, that doesn’’t work,” Fried says. ”If you’’re paying attention, you should have known. ”’ ’’ ’Hudson says that the response needs to go beyond training.’ ’”If a recommendation is just for some formal sensitivity or civil treatment training, and nothing else, that would be problematic and disappointing,” says Hudson.’ ’Other initiatives would be less welcome.’ ’”I’’m sure there’’s going to be some recommendation around mentoring women,” says Ruettimann. ”Whenever there’’s a problem, the answer is always to mentor women. ”’ ’”The problem with mentoring is that it rarely leads anywhere,” she says. ”You can mentor the hell out of a woman, but if you don’’t have a culture where she can get promoted based on her knowledge, skills or abilities, you’’ve got nothing. ”’ ”Hudson agreed, saying that Uber’s response shouldn’t be to simply settle for establishing training and initiatives that the company should have already had in place.” ’What’’s more, while the experts agreed that preemptive training is important, Ruettimann thinks it’’s not enough as a method of dealing with harassers: ”Training doesn’’t stop harassment. Zero tolerance policies stop harassment. ”’ ’”I’’m not quite sure how this shakes out for Uber, but nothing ends a culture of harassment quicker than firing the people who harass women and working hard to make sure that it doesn’’t happen again by promoting more women into leadership roles,” Ruettimann says.’ ’At the end of the day, if nothing changes, Uber  —   and other companies facing similar issues  —   could be in trouble. As things stand now, ”the lesson is don’’t work for Uber if you’’re talented, bright, and you want to associate yourself with a brand that respects people,” says .’ ’In February, Susan Fowler, a former Uber. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bolitho’s renderings of this rogue’s gallery   of figures is historically problematic in parts, but it   still makes for an interesting read  —   one that reveals quite a   lot about the author’s ideas about success and greatness. ” ’   The best chapter shone the spotlight on a young patrician from   ancient Rome named Lucius Sergius Catilina  —   commonly called   Catiline. In his typical exuberant fashion, Bolitho dubs Catiline   ”one of the most interesting possibilities in the history of the   world.” ’ ”   The author kicks off the character sketch with some notes on   background (describing Rome as a gilded, corrupt city and   comparing its trajectory to that of the US  —   according to   Bolitho, by 2029, we’ll very closely resemble the ancient   empire). He calls Catiline a figure that could arise in any   century  —   a patrician on the verge of being ousted from Rome’s   elite due to financial ruin. ” ”   Catiline also had more than a few skeletons in his closet, which   is impressive, considering this was a time before closets were   even invented. He’d messed up his tenure as governor of Africa   (the Roman province, not the entire continent); allegedly   murdered his   ; viciously persecuted rivals during a   coup; and seduced a Vestal Virgin who just happened to be the      of the consul Marcus Tullius Cicero . .. spoiler   alert: He’s going to come up again later. ” ’   At a certain point, drowning in debt and reeling from his mess of   a life, Catiline began plotting a ”blood of night and fire” to   kill Cicero, take over Rome, and abolish all debt. Bolitho   characterizes the scheme as ”. .. a sinister drollery, the simple   delight of stirring up great crowds to die and kill.” ’ ”   However, crushing, insurmountable debt was a huge issue for many   Romans. Whatever his motives (ulterior, pure, or otherwise)   Catiline’s cause proved popular amongst poor people and veterans   in particular. ” ’  ’ ’   The plan crumbled when a patrician woman named Fulvia became   aware of the plot and warned Cicero of his impending   assassination. After rounding up a number of conspirators, Cicero   showed up at the Senate and was surprised to find Catiline there,   too. ’ ’   Cicero proceeded to deliver a ”pitiless and unwavering” speech   denouncing Catiline and the conspiracy. It got so scathing that   all of the other senators began sliding away from Catiline, until   he was all alone on one side of the room. Exposed, the   conspirator fled Rome and led a hasty battle against the   Republic’’s forces. Catiline died in the fighting and the   conspiracy was squashed. ’ ’   Bolitho describes the young Roman aristocrat’’s adventure as ”one   of the most surprising of all,” as he did not have much to gain   considering the unlikelihood of the plot’’s success. This chapter   provides an interesting counterpoint to some of the more   positive, jovial depictions of adventurers elsewhere in the book. ’ ’   Catiline loathed the Roman system and promised change, but lacked   the temperament, planning skills, and ability to carry out his   idea. Once the plot was unveiled, he rushed into a hopeless   battle and only succeeded at getting himself and many of his   followers slaughtered. ’ ’   Regardless of his true motives, Catiline represents the darker   side of adventuring and innovation. Fresh, new ideas can go very   wrong and execution can be more important than ideas themselves. ’",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52360,72324,"Brothers share what it was like quitting their corporate jobs to sell ties on the beach and cofound Vineyard Vines, a company worth nearly $1 billion",Business Insider,Áine Cain,11/1/2016,2016,11,,"’  ’ ’   Shep Murray had one particularly bad day at work in 1998. ’ ’   During his annual performance review at the New York     marketing and communications company where the    worked   at the time, he  ’ ’   Instead, he quit. ’ ’   Later that day, he called his younger brother Ian, who was   working in Manhattan at a small public relations firm. ’ ”   Shep told his brother  —   who he knew was also unhappy at work  —     that he’d quit his job, and dared him to do the same. ” ”   Ian, then 23, called his brother back about five minutes later to   report that he’d followed suit. ” ”   Though the brothers were both out of work, they weren’t quite   falling without parachutes. They had a business idea in their   back pockets  —   and now they’d finally have time to pursue it. ” ’   During a 1997 trip to Anguilla, where their parents, who were   travel journalists, were on assignment, Shep and Ian had started   talking about  ’ ” ended up telling the resort’s general manager about   their idea. ” ’   ”We didn’’t know how to do it,” Shep said. ”The hotel manager   literally pulled out the New York City yellow pages. We started   calling neck tie manufacturers. That’’s how it all started.” ’ ’   But when they got back to New York, they briefly put the idea on   hold. ’ ’   That was, until they quit their jobs the following year. ’ ’  ’ ’   Once they were able to start pursuing this dream in earnest, it   was time to break the news to friends and family. ’ ’   ”Everyone thought we were crazy for leaving our respectable jobs   to go try something new,” Shep says. ”My girlfriend, who is now   my wife, was not happy.” ’ ’   When they first started their company  —   which would eventually   become Vineyard Vines, the preppy clothing brand that’’s now worth   close to $1 billion,   —   the brothers didn’’t receive ”any money   from anybody,” says Shep. ’ ’   But they had a plan and they hit the ground running. ’ ’   They bought an old Jeep and a Ford Bronco with their last couple   of paychecks and applied for as many credit cards as possible   while they still had credit. Cash advances from the new credit   cards helped to fund Vineyard Vines in the beginning. They used   contacts at their old firms to make connections in the fashion   and design world. Soon, they accrued an inventory of ties. ’ ’   ”Nobody was really wearing ties at the time, unless they were   going to a wedding or a graduation,” Ian says. ”We thought,   people aren’’t wearing ties because they’’re boring. But we used   that to our advantage.” ’ ’   To make neckties more appealing to more people  —   especially   young, preppy New Englanders  —   their idea was to create a product   line with whimsical and colorful patterns that ”could spark   conversations.” ’ ’  ’ ”   To build up their brand, the Murray brothers took an outdoorsy   approach to finding customers who would appreciate their   preppy,   ties. They would couch surf up and down   the eastern seaboard, carrying backpacks brimming with   merchandise. They’d bike and boat around beaches, hoping to find   interested customers. ” ’   ”We would sell a tie to anyone who would listen to us  —   and to   people who wouldn’’t,” Ian says. ’ ’   They also hawked ties at Junior League fairs, holiday boutiques,   bazaars, and church fairs. ’ ’   While they did encounter some interested customers, the brothers   also ran into a lot of naysayers as they embarked on their new   careers. ’ ’   ”People were always asking or thinking, ’’How could you possibly   give up these good jobs to do something seemingly stupid? ’’” says   Shep. Ian adds: ”People constantly talked down to us  —   but we   took it as a challenge.” ’ ’  ’ ’   Almost 20 years after starting their business, the brothers say   they’’ve never regretted quitting their ”stable jobs.” Shep   explains that embarking on their new, entrepreneurial path was   far more liberating than it was scary. ’ ’   ”People want job security and financial security,” Shep says.   ”The idea of passing on something that was perfectly good didn’’t   make sense. The idea of being able to go out and make money doing   something as stupid as making neckties just seemed like a crazy   thing. The reality is, we were really passionate about going out   and making it on our own. We were really passionate about the   products we made. We felt that if we were passionate, other   people would be to.” ’ ’   Ian says that despite the rough patches in the beginning, the   brothers were able to rely on each other for support and found   that their different skill sets often complemented one another.   (Ian majored in English in college and had a background in PR,   while Shep majored in business and had a background in   advertising.) ’ ’   They also had a trick for keeping themselves motivated each day. ’ ’   ”It would be very easy to just sit on the couch and watch ’’The   Price is Right,’’” Ian says. ”So we would make a   list every   morning, and would make sure every day we added ten things to   it.” ’ ’   Writing out their priorities allowed them to stay focused on   their goals, even without the structure of the traditional      workday or office environment. ’ ’  ’ ’   The Murray brothers worked from home in the beginning, and later   began renting larger office spaces in Connecticut, which is where   they grew up. ’ ’   Its proximity to both New York City and  ’ ’   Today, there are 91 Vineyard Vines stores across the country. The   company is on track to hire 650 employees (to boost its     workforce) even as other brands with similar   aesthetics face struggles this year, . ’ ”   Vineyard Vines has also expanded its product line to include   bags, clothing, and swimwear for men, women, and children  —   but   it’s still known for its bright, playful prints. ” ’   ”Our ties spoke to people,” Ian says. ”They said something about   the person before they even opened their mouth. That’’s why so   many people early on identified with our products. Really early   on, we had George H. W. Bush wearing our bonefish ties, because he   loved to go bone fishing, and we had John Kerry wearing our   lacrosse ties, because he loved to play lacrosse.” ’ ’  ’ ’   Looking back on their old careers, the brothers say they ”miss   nothing.” They especially enjoy not having to wear suits anymore,   or commuting to and from New York City every day. ’ ’   When they first made the leap, Shep says they ”felt empowered by   being our own bosses, regardless of what anyone else thought.” ’ ’   He adds that his best advice for aspiring entrepreneurs is to   ”quit your job while you’’re young.” ’ ”   He notes it’s better to focus on pursuing your passion and   gaining varied and interesting career experience than it is to   suffer through a job that pays well or looks great on your   résumé. ” ’   ”Quality of life was more important to us than financial gain,”   Ian says. ”That still is what drives us and drives our team. It’’s   extremely rewarding to be around   people.” ’ ’   However, the brothers note that going for your dreams can get   harder as you age. They see many peers in their 30s or 40s who   feel unfilled in their corporate jobs, but are unable to leave   due to financial obligations. ’ ’   ”You don’’t want to go to your grave saying you wish you had tried   something,” Shep says. ”If you don’’t try it, how can you know if   you’’re going to succeed? I think a lot of people measure success   financially. If you do that, it doesn’’t necessarily always lead   to a happier, more productive life. Make sure you do things for   the right reasons.” ’",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1263,18710,Wearable Fitness Devices Don’t Seem to Make You Fitter - The New York Times,New York Times,Aaron E. Carroll,3/6/2017,2017,3,,"I once received a lot of blowback for an Upshot article in which I showed (with evidence) that exercise is not the key to weight loss. Diet is. Many, many readers cannot wrap their head around the notion that adding physical activity, and therefore burning more calories, doesn’t necessarily translate into results on the scale. Well, here we go again because some of those folks also believe that fitness devices  —   Fitbit, Vivosmart, Apple Watch  —   must be helpful in losing weight. Unfortunately, evidence doesn’t support this belief either. For some time, people have been trying to prove devices like these succeed in promoting weight loss. In 2011, a study compared four groups getting a mixture of behavioral weight loss programs and use of an armband that measured activity and energy expenditure. All the intervention groups lost weight, but those with behavioral programs and technology lost the most. The sample size of each group (fewer than 50) and the large dropout rate of the study should temper enthusiasm, though. The sample was also mostly female, and more than   of them had college degrees, so the results may not be entirely generalizable. In 2015, another study, the   trial, was also inconclusive. Researchers randomly assigned 250 people ages 60 to 75 to one of two groups. The first group received four physical activity consultations from primary care nurses over three months a pedometer and a physical activity diary. The other received “usual care. ” All patients were given accelerometers to measure their activity, although only the control group saw the results. One year later, those in the pedometer group were taking an average of about 600 more steps per day, and had about 40 more minutes of activity a week. But it’s hard in a trial like this to know how much of that was because of the pedometer and the feedback, and how much was because of the nurse visits and coaching. What was needed was a large,   study that truly teased out the contribution of wearable tech to weight loss programs. Last year, the results of such a study, the IDEA trial, were published. The trial took place at the University of Pittsburgh between 2010 and 2012, and it involved more than 470 adults between the ages of 18 and 35. All of them were put on a   diet, had group counseling sessions and were advised to increase their physical activity. Six months into the intervention, all were given telephone counseling sessions,   prompts and study materials online. At that time, though, half were also given wearable tech devices that monitored their activity and connected to a website to help provide feedback. All participants were followed for 18 more months. At the end of the two years, which is pretty long for a weight loss study, those without access to the wearable technology lost an average of 13 pounds. Those with the wearable tech lost an average of 7. 7 pounds. It’s hard for many to accept, so I’m going to state the results again: Those people who used the wearable tech for 18 months lost significantly less weight than those who didn’t. You may rightfully point out that the primary reason to wear the devices isn’t to lose weight  —   it’s to be more active. But even in this respect, it didn’t work nearly as well as we might hope. In the IDEA trial, those who employed the technology were no more physically active than those who didn’t. They also weren’t more fit. Many new technologies, and dietary supplements and new diets, are sold to the public with little actual research behind them. Wearable technology to encourage fitness is no different. Somehow, in the past few years, it has become collectively understood that we need to take 10, 000 steps a day. But there’s no magic behind that number. There’s no reason to believe that hitting this arbitrary goal is somehow  . Exercise is worthwhile for its own sake. Of course, many people can enjoy using wearable tech without tying it to weight loss goals. I have owned a Fitbit, a Nike FuelBand and an Apple Watch. I still wear the watch because I like many of its features. When I first bought it, I liked how it tracked my daily 30 minutes of physical activity and reminded me to stand up every so often. But I realized over time that I didn’t really need it. After some months, getting 30 minutes of activity a day (the recommended amount) became part of my routine. I learned to be more mobile and less sedentary. I didn’t need the precision or the reminders anymore. It’s possible that the devices helped me make physical activity part of my regular routine. It’s possible that they provided a benefit. But my experience is just an anecdote, and there’s no counterfactual to help figure out whether I’d have become more active without the devices. For that, we’d need a trial. The ones that exist (like the IDEA trial) argue that the devices don’t make people exercise more. They don’t seem to hurt, though. Other than costing money, there’s no harm in seeing if it might improve your activity over time. But if your goal is weight loss, then you might think twice about using such a device. The evidence suggests that you may do better without one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1589,19065,Exciting Microbe Research? Temper That Giddy Feeling in Your Gut - The New York Times,New York Times,Aaron E. Carroll,3/7/2017,2017,3,,"While we have long known about the existence of microbes  —   the tiny bacteria, fungi and archaea that live all around, on and in us  —   our full relationship has become one of the hottest topics for research only in recent years. Scientists believe that every person contains as many independent microbial cells as human cells. This collection of life, known as the microbiome, provides useful functions for us. Indeed, some of the things we think our bodies do are actually the abilities and enzymes of   living within us. They can help with digestion, vitamin synthesis and even immunological responses. But, as with many new breakthroughs and advances, the hype of the microbiome often outweighs the reality. This seems especially likely in the field of nutrition. Doing research on the microbiome is not easy, and there are many opportunities to foul things up. To accomplish human studies, large samples of people and microbiomes are needed to account for potential confounding variables. Specimens have to be collected and stored carefully because contamination has been a big problem. DNA has to be extracted, amplified and sequenced. Finally, powerful bioinformatics tools are necessary to assemble and analyze the huge amount of data contained in a sequence of nucleotides  —   all of which has resulted in a wide range of new “omics,” including genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics. Of course, if we think that microbes play a large role in health, we have to rethink the role that antimicrobials play in our lives. In this thinking, antibiotics and antifungals could be   or  . But that’s not the case. There are many reasons to avoid unnecessary use of these medications, but the microbiome appears able to withstand most treatment. Still, antimicrobials clearly have an effect on the microbiome. Many studies, along with common sense, suggest that when we treat people with antibiotics, we change the amount and type of microbes that live in our gut. We’ve seen this with Clostridium difficile. C. diff, as it is also known, is a bacterium that lives in many healthy people. The presence of other microbes keeps its numbers in check. But when we treat people with antibiotics that kill off other bacteria, but not C. diff, it can increase its presence and lead to serious illness. Infection with C. diff is hard to treat, and it’s not uncommon. In 2011 in the United States, there were more than 450, 000 cases, causing 29, 000 deaths. A number of studies have shown promise in using the microbiome to treat C. diff. Fecal transplant (which is exactly what it sounds like) effectively fixes a damaged microbiome by infusing it with a healthy one. This type of therapy could theoretically work in treating other diseases. But there’s a huge gap between “holds promise” and “definitive treatment. ” After all, there’s a direct biological explanation for why the microbiome and antibiotics play a role in C. diff. That direct link is much harder to describe when talking about other disorders. Many have postulated that the microbiome has an important part to play in inflammatory bowel diseases, which, because of my condition, I follow quite closely. Others have attempted to link it to disorders of development and behavior, like autism. Because the microbiome takes root in childhood, studies have explored if pregnancy, method of delivery or even the environment might hold some meaning in the microbiome’s development and later health. Even more significantly, many have begun to hypothesize that it has a significant role in the current obesity epidemic. Studies have shown that transferring the microbiome from a thin mouse to an obese one, or vice versa, could lead to a change in body size to match. It was this type of study that roused much of your ire when I dismissed it in my discussion of artificial sweeteners. Other studies show that changes in diet can change the microbiome in human beings. But when you analyze all these studies together, as scientists did in a   last summer, the certainty of those links becomes much less certain. This doesn’t mean that the microbiome doesn’t play a role in nutrition. Some important research has begun to show that chronic malnutrition probably causes changes in the microbiome that make treating the problem much harder than many anticipate. Problems with substandard sanitation can also contribute to microbial changes in very poor environments, compounding the problems of malnutrition. But we haven’t yet figured out how to translate these findings into easily used treatments. The problem with getting too enthusiastic about the microbiome isn’t much different from the problem with getting too enthusiastic about any research advances. Many mistake correlation for causation just because some people have a different microbiome doesn’t mean that microbes are responsible for other differences. Studies in mice are not the same as studies of humans diet is incredibly complex, and rarely do results in genetically similar animals easily translate to diverse groups of people. And the microbiome is very, very complicated. We understand so little about it, and the idea that we can make accurate representations about it, let alone manipulate it, is somewhat  . As with the genome before it, our greater understanding of the microbiome has spurred great excitement and interest. Last May, the White House began the National Microbiome Initiative, with huge public and private investment into research. We hope these investments will yield great returns, but it will be important to temper our enthusiasm with an appropriate amount of skepticism. Health advances usually proceed more slowly than the hype.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2530,20109,Birth Control Causes Depression? Not So Fast - The New York Times,New York Times,Aaron E. Carroll,4/19/2017,2017,4,,"One of the biggest American public health victories of the last decade has been the record low reached in the teenage birthrate. Along with that have been lows in rates for teenage pregnancy and abortion. Most researchers believe that improved access to contraception is a large part of this success. But news continues to focus on the concern that   contraception  —   like the pill or the patch  —   causes depression, and that this should lead us to question its wider use. A more nuanced discussion would consider both the benefits and the harms. This issue drew widespread coverage at the end of last year with a large study published in JAMA Psychiatry. Researchers tracked all women and adolescent females (ages 15 to 34) living in Denmark from 2000 through 2014. The study found that those who used hormonal contraception had significantly higher risks of also taking an antidepressant. The study broke down the increased relative risk for each hormonal method this way: combined oral contraceptives (23 percent)   pills (34 percent) the patch (100 percent) vaginal ring (60 percent) and levonorgestrel intrauterine system (40 percent). The risks were highest in adolescents and decreased as women aged. The risks also peaked six months after the start of contraception. Needless to say, many news outlets covered this finding widely. Some portrayed it as shocking new information that should change the way we think about hormonal birth control. Others saw it as a vindication of many women who said for years that birth control had triggered their depression while scientists and doctors ignored them. But we have to acknowledge the limitations of this type of research. It’s not a controlled trial, and it’s impossible to establish causality. Women who choose to have sex could also be more likely to consider antidepressant use. Women who are plugged in enough to the health care system to obtain hormonal contraception could be more likely to have their depression appropriately diagnosed and treated  —   which is a good thing. It’s also possible that an antidepressant prescription isn’t the best measure of   depression. That would require an actual diagnosis by a health care professional, and such data were not available in the Danish cohort. Previous studies that looked at rates of severe depression did not find a correlation with hormonal birth control use. Finally, huge cohort studies using many participants are likely to find a statistically significant result even if that result is not clinically significant. This is especially true if the cohort data come from an administrative database, like the one used in this study, that has been specifically identified as problematic in prior publications. We also have to place this study in context with others. Months earlier, a systematic review of all studies that looked at the relationship between hormonal contraception and depression was published in The European Journal of Contraception and Reproductive Health Care. The authors first noted that there were too few prospective studies. But the data that do exist show that most women don’t show any effect from hormonal birth control, or actually had their mood improve. Adverse effects were rare, and even rarer when the contraception contained lower levels of the hormone progestin. Finally, women who have underlying mood disorders were more predisposed to have   side effects, but that could be related to their choosing different types of birth control rather than the birth control itself. When many studies do not find a connection, and then one does, that latter one does not “replace” all prior research. That study has to be weighed along with the rest. It’s also important to consider publication bias, in which a study is more likely to be published if it’s a “significant” result and if it’s newsy. In this case, the finding that common birth control causes depression is both. But let us assume, for the sake of argument, that this most recent finding is both real and causal. Even then, we need to rely on absolute risks, not relative risks. In the Denmark study, for every 100 women who didn’t use hormonal birth control, 1. 7 were later prescribed an antidepressant. For every 100 who did use hormonal birth control, 2. 2 were later prescribed an antidepressant. The overall difference (0. 5 percentage points) means that if this were a randomized controlled trial, we would expect that for every 200 women treated, one extra woman might need to be treated with an antidepressant. We can also assume, though, that pretty much all of them would receive the benefit of birth control in family planning. Moreover, lest anyone forget, depression is also significantly associated with pregnancy, especially when that pregnancy is unintended. None of this is to say that we should ignore the risk of depression. Depression is a listed side effect of birth control it’s on the package inserts. All drugs have side effects. The drug I take for my ulcerative colitis has a real, if small, risk of causing myelosuppression. But the benefits I receive from it simply outweigh the risks. Women need to discuss with their physicians the potential downsides, as well as the potential upsides, of all forms of contraception. We shouldn’t ignore the potential for hormonal birth control to cause mood changes in women. We also shouldn’t pay attention only to those side effects, forgetting to place them in context with the benefits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3193,20823,"Helpless to Prevent Cancer? Actually, Quite a Bit Is in Your Control - The New York Times",New York Times,Aaron E. Carroll,8/30/2016,2016,8,,"Americans seem very afraid of cancer, with good reason. Unlike other things that kill us, it often seems to come out of nowhere. But evidence has increasingly accumulated that cancer may be preventable, too. Unfortunately, this has inflamed as much as it has assuaged people’s fears. As a physician, I have encountered many people who believe that heart disease, which is the single biggest cause of death among Americans, is largely controllable. After all, if people ate better, were physically active and stopped smoking, then lots of them would get better. This ignores the fact that people can’t change many risk factors of heart disease like age, race and family genetics. People don’t often seem to feel the same way about cancer. They think it’s out of their control. A study published in Science in January 2015 seemed to support that view. It tried to explain why some tissues lead to cancer more often than others. It found a strong correlation between the number of times a cell divides in the course of a lifetime and the risk of developing cancer. In other words, this study argued that the more times DNA replicates, the more often something can go wrong. Some took this to mean that cancer is much more because of “bad luck” than because of other factors that people could control. Unfortunately, this simple explanation is not really what the study showed. Lung cells, for instance, divide quite rarely, and still account for a significant amount of cancer. Cells in the gastrointestinal tract divide all the time and account for many fewer cancers. Some cancers, like melanoma, were found to be in the group of cancers influenced more by intrinsic factors (or those we can’t control) when we clearly know that extrinsic factors, like sun exposure, are a major cause. Further, this study was focused more on the relative risks of cancer in one type of tissue versus another. What we really care about is how much we can reduce our own risk of cancer by changing our behavior. A more recent study published in Nature argues that there is a lot we can do. Many studies have shown that environmental risk factors and exposures contribute greatly to many cancers. Diet is related to colorectal cancer. Alcohol and tobacco are related to esophageal cancer. HPV is related to cervical cancer, and hepatitis C is related to liver cancer. And you’d have to be living under a rock not to know that smoking causes lung cancer and that too much sun can lead to skin cancer. Using sophisticated modeling techniques, the researchers argued that less than 30 percent of the lifetime risk of getting many common cancers was because of intrinsic risk factors, or the “bad luck. ” The rest were things you can change. Most recently, in JAMA Oncology, researchers sought to quantify how a healthful lifestyle might actually alter the risk of cancer. They identified four domains that are often noted to be related to disease prevention: smoking, drinking, obesity and exercise. They defined people who engaged in healthy levels of all of these activities as a “low risk” group. Then they compared their risk of getting cancer with people who weren’t in this group. They included two groups of people who have been followed and studied a long time, the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals   Study, as well as national cancer statistics. Of the nearly 90, 000 women and more than 46, 000 men, 16, 531 women and 11, 731 men fell into the   group. For each type of cancer, researchers calculated a   risk, which is the percentage of people who develop cancer who might have avoided it had they adopted   behaviors. About 82 percent of women and 78 percent of men who got lung cancer might have prevented it through healthy behaviors. About 29 percent of women and 20 percent of men might have prevented colon and rectal cancer. About 30 percent of both might have prevented pancreatic cancer. Breast cancer was much less preventable: 4 percent. Over all, though, about 25 percent of cancer in women and 33 percent in men was potentially preventable. Close to half of all cancer deaths might be prevented as well. No study is perfect, and this is no exception. These cohorts are overwhelmingly white and consist of health professionals, who are not necessarily like the population at large. But the checks against the national data showed that if anything, these results might be underestimating how much cancer is preventable by healthy behaviors. This also isn’t a randomized controlled trial, and we can certainly argue that it doesn’t prove causation. A bigger concern to me is that people might interpret these findings as assigning fault to people who get cancer. You don’t want to get into situations where you feel as if people don’t deserve help because they didn’t try hard enough to stay healthy. Much of cancer is still out of people’s control. I was especially worried because, in this study, “low risk” status required all four healthy lifestyles. Failing in any one domain put you in the   category, and that seemed like a lot to ask of people. On further reading, though, I discovered that the requirements weren’t overly burdensome. Not smoking was defined as never having smoked or having quit at least five years ago. That’s clearly good for health. Moderate alcohol consumption was defined as no more than one drink a day on average for women, and no more than two for men. That’s pretty much what I have argued for in writing about this issue in the past it in no way requires abstinence. Adequate weight was defined as a B. M. I. of at least 18. 5 and no more than 27. 5. The cutoff for “overweight” is 25, meaning that you don’t have to be thin you just have to be less than obese (B. M. I. 30). Finally, exercise was defined as 150 minutes a week of   activity or 75 minutes of   activity. That’s a reasonable and quite achievable goal. I was surprised to realize that I’m already “low risk. ” I bet many people reading this are “low risk,” too. As we talk about cancer “moonshots” that will most likely cost billions of dollars and might not achieve results, it’s worth considering that  —   as in many cases  —   prevention is not only the cheapest course, but also the most effective. Simple changes to people’s behaviors have the potential to make sure many cancers never occur. They have a side benefit of preventing health problems in many other areas, too. Investment in these efforts may not be as exciting, but it may yield greater results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3923,21632,In Defense of Moderate Drinking (Again) - The New York Times,New York Times,Aaron E. Carroll,9/9/2016,2016,9,,"A few months ago, I wrote an article here on The Upshot discussing the potential health effects of alcohol. I pointed out that the scientific research said moderate drinking isn’t bad for you indeed, it might even offer some benefits. At the same time, I cautioned that this doesn’t mean I’d treat alcohol like medicine, or advise people to start drinking. The   message was that if you’re otherwise healthy, and enjoy no more than two drinks a day, you’re unlikely to suffer from it, and potentially might benefit. However, a new study has been published that is leading some people to write stories proclaiming that “alcohol may not be good for you after all. ” Is that the case? Like any good Bayesian, I use new data and evidence to update my priors. In this case, the recent publication isn’t a new trial or experiment. It’s a new systematic review and   that argues that it does a better job than prior work, by excluding a lot of research its authors declared was flawed. The main problem, they argue, is that a lot of prior work lumps people who used to drink but quit and no longer do so with people who never drank. They further assert that many of these people may actually have quit because they were sick, and were told to give up alcohol. This would mean that the sickest patients, who had been drinking alcohol, were being counted as if they were abstainers, which would bias results in a way to make drinking look healthier than not. They also only looked at studies that examined all death from all causes considered together. Of the 87 studies they found that met this criterion, only 13 strictly coded lifetime abstainers (and not quitters) as the reference group. When they looked at those studies and compared lifetime abstainers with everyday drinkers, there wasn’t a statistically significant difference. Only those who drank at least 65 grams of alcohol a day (about 4. 5 drinks) had an increased risk of death. The researchers refined their model further, excluding “lesser quality studies,” to consider only seven. The results were unchanged. They then excluded one more study that had results heavily favoring alcohol the remaining six studies suggested that people who drank two to three drinks a day had a slightly elevated risk of death. But those who drank one to two, or three to 4. 5 drinks, didn’t. When it comes to observational research, that’s a pretty weak finding. But that conclusion is somehow making headlines. If you look closely, it’s clear the authors excluded a lot of studies that seem to have already taken into account their concerns. For instance, one study I cited looked at   mortality for those 55 to 65 years old. It found that, after controlling for the prior drinkers, as well as other confounders, those who drank a moderate amount had a lower risk of death than abstainers as well as heavy drinkers. It also cited five different earlier studies (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that accounted for the “former drinker” problem, yet still found the protective effect of    drinking against   mortality. It’s unclear to me why these studies didn’t factor in to the new analysis. That doesn’t mean the researchers did anything wrong. You’ve always got to make judgment calls about what to include in a  . But the researchers don’t clearly explain why they made the judgment calls they did in the text. That makes me concerned they might be  . It’s also important to recognize that this is only a study of   mortality. Many other outcomes exist. A 2011   for example, looked at mortality from a variety of cardiovascular causes. This analysis also performed a   of studies that classified former drinkers correctly. It found that  —   with or without this adjustment  —   active drinkers had both a lower incidence and mortality from a variety of cardiovascular disease. In the same vein, other studies have found associations with alcohol and better cognitive function and lower rates of diabetes. (The story for cancer is much more mixed.) On top of that, randomized controlled trials suggest that moderate drinking can help with diabetes, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. There’s even a   of 63 controlled trials showing alcohol’s positive effects on HDL (good) cholesterol. Authors of articles now declaring alcohol to be   will need to explain why they ignored those trials. At best then, this new study shows that for those drinking two or fewer drinks of alcohol a day, there’s no association with higher or lower risks of death. At worst, it’s leaving out trials that show a benefit. In others words, the study doesn’t make me think I should update my priors much at all. The evidence still says that a moderate amount of alcohol appears to be safe, and that it might even be healthy for many people. There’s nothing in this new analysis that would make me change my mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4005,21726,How Yelp Reviews Can Help Improve Patient Care - The New York Times,New York Times,Aaron E. Carroll,9/17/2016,2016,9,,"Hospitals and many insurance carriers care about patient satisfaction. It especially matters to hospitals because insurance payments can be influenced by how patients rate the care they receive, as well as by the health of the patient, which hospitals usually report. Many people in the health care profession are put off by this. They argue that patient satisfaction scores aren’t necessarily aligned with outcomes. Moreover, they say that trying to improve satisfaction is a waste of time. It’s possible, however, that patient satisfaction is being rewarded already, and that the efforts we are making to highlight it aren’t helping as much as we think. Almost every study on patient satisfaction uses the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (H. C. A. H. P. S.) survey. Studies show it is correlated with clinical measures of quality, although some other studies dispute this. Collecting such information is costly, but there may be other sources for quality assessments that don’t require investment from the health care system. In 2012, researchers in the Journal of General Internal Medicine examined online reviews from RateMDs. com and Yelp. They found that a majority of reviews were positive. They noted, however, that patients reported on aspects of care that extended beyond the   encounter. They were concerned about staff, access to the hospital and convenience. They also cared greatly about the bedside manner of the doctors they encountered. Dr. Naomi Bardach, associate professor of pediatrics and health policy at U. C. S. F. Benioff Children’s Hospital San Francisco, and her colleagues looked at Yelp to determine how consumer ratings compared with those of the hospital consumer assessment survey. Of the almost 3, 800 hospitals with survey and other data, about 25 percent also had ratings on Yelp. The correlation between Yelp and the survey was quite strong. Moreover, high ratings at Yelp were correlated with lower mortality for myocardial infarctions and pneumonia  —   and fewer readmissions for those problems as well as heart failure. A recent study in Health Affairs expanded on this work. Researchers compared the content of Yelp narrative reviews with the factors considered important in the hospital consumer assessment survey. They found that Yelp reviews did cover most things the survey tallied. But they also covered an additional 12 criteria not in the survey. These included the cost of a visit insurance and billing scheduling compassion of staff family member care and the quality of many staff members. All of these things were important to patients, and all might be correlated with outcomes. More important, nine of the 15 most prevalent criteria in reviews were not included in the survey. The use of metrics like the hospital consumer assessment survey assumes that those in the health care system have figured out how best to measure patient satisfaction. They also assume that all the information we need should come from patients or from the medical record. That’s not how the real world works. In a more recent study, Dr. Bardach found that the perceptions of other family members matter and can also be powerful because they focus on safety in a way that patients may not be able to do. The same is true of those who help care for patients at home and help make medical decisions for them. Their opinions are ignored by the survey. Those publicly available data may even be more comprehensive than that gathered at the behest of payers. The next question is whether the health care system needs to measure satisfaction  —   maybe the publicly available data, like at Yelp, is sufficient. Could those data be used alone to incentivize providers? A couple of weeks ago, my colleague Austin Frakt wrote a column on hospital quality and market share. He argued that people could improve their health by choosing a hospital that has a higher quality rating. He also underscored that patient satisfaction scores are often aligned with quality and with better outcomes. He highlighted a paper published in The American Economic Review that looked at how performance of hospitals was related to market share. Conventional wisdom holds that patients lack information on quality and that they cannot tell, or favor, providers who seem better. But researchers found that hospitals that performed better, on both outcomes and   measures, tended to have greater market share, and experienced greater market growth. Further, they found that as patients shifted to hospitals with higher performance, that change alone drove a significant amount in the improvements seen in overall survival rates for a number of conditions. Overall survival improved, in part, just because patients shifted from hospitals with lower quality to higher quality. If patients had the ability to choose between hospitals, they tended to gravitate to those with higher performance. In other words, this may be an area of health care where the free market is working. When allowed to choose, patients seem able to discern quality  —   as they define it  —   and gravitate toward it. It’s not clear that we need to be forcing the issue with measurement and reimbursement. It’s important to recognize, though, that this was a study of Medicare patients, all of whom arguably have more flexibility in terms of hospitals and doctors than those with private insurance. Those with private insurance often are restricted by “narrow networks” and directed to a few facilities and offices. Americans cry out for more choice in their health care. This sometimes gets translated to mean a choice of insurance companies. But Americans with   Medicare, who have the least choice of insurers, have the most choices when it comes to providers. And they seem to use that freedom to choose providers who perform better. I asked Dr. Bardach about this. “It’s still unclear how people are getting the information to choose the hospitals, but the power of stories is likely an important part of why Yelp and other online reviews are compelling,” she said. “Stories add nuance and context to the otherwise somewhat sterile numbers that the H. C. A. H. P. S. produces. ” Research shows that patients reward quality on their own  —   when they can. We might just need to make it easier for more of them to do so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5246,23136,Avoiding Peanuts to Avoid an Allergy Is a Bad Strategy for Most - The New York Times,New York Times,Aaron E. Carroll,1/5/2017,2017,1,,"This article originally ran in April. We are resurfacing it in light of new guidelines from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that advise giving peanuts to children early and often as a strategy to forestall an allergy.  It has become an article of faith among many women I know to eliminate some foods during pregnancy, out of concern that their children could become allergic to them: shellfish, dairy and, most of all, peanuts. After their babies arrive, they continue to abstain from certain foods while   and they certainly keep their children from eating them. But research in the last few years has consistently shown that all this avoidance often does more harm than good. In many cases, we need to be doing the opposite. Mothers didn’t adopt this behavior out of nowhere. In 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics released guidelines on reducing a child’s risk for developing allergies. They recommended that mothers “eliminate peanuts and tree nuts (e. g. almonds, walnuts, etc.) and consider eliminating eggs, cow’s milk, fish, and perhaps other foods from their diets while nursing. ” Further, they recommended that children at high risk for allergies be given no solid foods until six months of age, no dairy products until 1 year old, no eggs until age 2, and no peanuts, nuts or fish until age 3. A debate has been raging in the health care system for decades on this topic. I was part of a systematic review that examined the relationship between early solid food introduction and allergic disease in children. We found no good evidence to support the idea that being exposed to solid foods earlier led to persistent food allergies. To its credit, the A. A. P. changed its recommendations based on new research. In 2008, updated guidelines reported that maternal restrictions in pregnancy or   no longer seemed like advice that should be widely recommended. It also acknowledged that there didn’t seem much reason to delay the introduction of “allergy” foods like peanuts after six months, around the age babies move from milk or formula to a wider range of food. Unfortunately, this did little to change people’s behavior. Many had already internalized the advice. It seemed logical to them that avoiding foods would give children less of a chance to develop allergies. If it was still a good idea not to expose children until they were six months old, why not keep going? A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine last year turned all of this on its head. Researchers enrolled 640 infants at high risk for allergies, between 4 and 11 months of age, in a trial and randomized them to one of two groups. One of them was to avoid peanut protein the other was to eat at least six grams of peanut protein a week given in three or more meals. All participants were followed until they were 5 years old. What was most surprising in this work was that 15 percent of the infants already had evidence of peanut sensitivity by allergy testing. They were enrolled in the trial despite this, and half of them were given peanut extract every week. The results were remarkable. At the end of the study, about 3 percent of those exposed to peanuts had developed a peanut allergy, compared with more than 17 percent among those who avoided peanuts. More surprising, if you looked just at the children who already had evidence of peanut sensitivity when they were babies, fewer than 11 percent of those regularly exposed to peanuts developed an allergy. But more than 35 percent of those who avoided peanuts developed an allergy. Children who had proven sensitivity to peanuts, but consumed them in their diet regularly, were less likely to develop a peanut allergy than children without sensitivity who avoided them. Recently,   results were published. After the trial ended, researchers asked all the participants who had been regularly consuming peanuts to avoid them for the next 12 months. At the end of that period, when the children were 6, there was no significant increase in new peanut allergies in that group. Avoidance at this point made no difference. The critical need for exposure appears to be somewhere from infancy until age 5. These results were so convincing that, once again, experts are changing their recommendations. In September 2015, the A. A. P.  —   along with others  —   argued that “health care providers should recommend introducing   products into the diets of ‘ ’ infants early on in life. ” These changes dovetail nicely within what has become known as the hygiene hypothesis, the gist of which is that as we’ve made our environment more and more sterile, our immune systems develop differently than they used to. Without exposure to outside things to fight, our defenses turn inward and toward more benign substances, leading to increased levels of eczema, asthma and allergies. Of course, many people used to die from infections that no longer threaten us because of advances, so no one should take this as a call for living in filth. Nor should anyone take these recent findings as advice to feed babies and small children peanuts and other foods without concern. All changes to an infant’s diet, especially in children with allergies, should be done in consultation with a health care professional. As with many things in health care, however, we went too far with our response to peanut and other food allergies. Avoidance is sometimes needed for those with severe reactions. When we apply those same rules to everyone else, however, things can backfire.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5770,23813,"The EpiPen, a Case Study in Health System Dysfunction - The New York Times",New York Times,Aaron E. Carroll,8/30/2016,2016,8,,"Three times in the last two weeks, people  —   a patient, a colleague and my wife  —   told me stories about how out of control the price of EpiPens were. Monday, my New York Times colleagues recounted in detail how expensive the devices have become in recent years. All tell the tale of how much even basic health care can cost in the United States. But by digging a bit further, the story of EpiPens can also explain so much of what’s wrong with our health care system. When people think of allergies to drugs, food or a bee sting, they often think of a rash. And in fact that’s how many allergic reactions develop and proceed. Most can be treated with diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and careful observation. But some are more serious. Between 1 and 2 percent of people can develop what’s known as anaphylaxis, when the airways you need to breathe swell and close. Luckily, there’s a simple treatment for such reactions. Epinephrine  —   or adrenaline  —   is a hormone naturally produced by the adrenal glands. It’s part of your “fight or flight” response, and it causes your heart to beat faster, your blood vessels to constrict, your pupils to dilate and  —   most important here  —   your airways to open. Epinephrine is very, very cheap. Even in the developing world, it costs less than a dollar per milliliter, and there’s less than a third of that in an EpiPen. But to save a life, epinephrine must be delivered quickly, and in the proper amounts. People suffering severe allergic reactions often can’t do it themselves. Drawing the drug into a syringe and then administering it to someone else requires training and precision that most people lack. For that, there is the EpiPen. What makes this   device so special is not the drug, but the ease with which it automatically administers the correct dose without delay. The instructions are right on the side, and even if you don’t read them, it’s pretty easy to figure out. Pull off the safety cap, put the tip against the thigh, and push. Boom. Epinephrine delivered. The EpiPen isn’t new it has been in use since 1977. Research and development costs were recouped long ago. Nine years ago, it was bought by the pharmaceutical company Mylan, which then began to sell the device. When Mylan bought it, EpiPens cost about $57 each. Few competitors existed, and for various reasons, that has remained the case. The device actually worked and saved lives. People needed it. Mylan raised the price. It also began to raise awareness. Unfortunately, epinephrine is inherently unstable. Research shows that it degrades pretty quickly over time, and it’s recommended that EpiPens be replaced every year. When my friends ask me if they can take an expired    pain medication like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, I shrug and nod. If they don’t get a full dose, it’s usually not a big deal. But epinephrine is no joke. People in anaphylaxis need a full dose every time. They therefore need to replace all their EpiPens every year, again and again. Kids need them in many places. They need them at home. They need them at school. They need them at camp. They may even want to stash one at Grandma’s house. So people often need to buy quite a few. More revenue for Mylan. And it raised the price. Then in 2010, federal guidelines changed to recommend that two EpiPens be sold in a package instead of one. Studies showed that about 10 percent of children who received epinephrine from an EpiPen needed more than one dose. Better to be safe than sorry. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration changed its recommendations to allow for the prescription of EpiPens for prevention for   patients, not just for those with confirmed allergies. Mylan stopped selling individual EpiPens and began to sell only  . It also raised the price. In 2013, the government went further. It passed a law that gave funding preferences for asthma treatment grants to states that maintained an emergency supply of EpiPens. As the near sole supplier of the devices, Mylan stood to make even more money. That year, Mylan raised the price again. Of course, competition would bring the price down. But it’s  very hard to bring such a device to market. In 2012, the Adrenaclick and Twinject were discontinued. In 2013, Sanofi began to sell   devices, which even gave audio instructions to walk people though their use. Unfortunately, they were found to give potentially improper doses, and were pulled from the shelves about a year ago. Teva had hoped to offer a generic version of the EpiPen, but concerns from the F. D. A. sent it back to the drawing board until at least next year. Adamis hoped to offer prefilled syringes, which would still be harder to use than EpiPens. But it was told by the F. D. A. that much more data would be needed before such a product could be sold. These setbacks, all in the last year, have once again left Mylan with a veritable run of the market. It raised the price of EpiPens again. As of this May, they cost more than $600 a pack. Since 2004, after adjusting for inflation, the price of EpiPens has risen more than 450 percent. An alternative still exists. The Adrenaclick, while still not cheap, is back and less expensive than the EpiPen. Some think it’s harder to use, though. It’s not on the accepted list for many health insurance plans. More important, few physicians think of it. Because of that, they write prescriptions for EpiPens. Since the Adrenaclick is not a generic version of the EpiPen, pharmacists can’t substitute one for the other. A prescription for an EpiPen must be filled with an EpiPen, regardless of what consumers might want. Some people argue that we could still just use syringes and epinephrine for far less money. Sure, they would expire every few months. Sure, they would be harder to use and likelier to break. Sure, they would require training, be hard for the uninitiated to use in an emergency and be more likely to be administered with an incorrect dose. Nonetheless, you could argue that they’re an alternative when the “Cadillac” EpiPens are financially out of reach. But those are unsatisfactory arguments. Epinephrine isn’t an elective medication. It doesn’t last, so people need to purchase the drug repeatedly. There’s little competition, but there are huge hurdles to enter the market, so a company can raise the price again and again with little pushback. The government encourages the product’s use, but makes no effort to control its cost. Insurance coverage shields some from the expense, allowing higher prices, but leaves those most   most exposed to extreme    outlays. The poor are the most likely to consider going without because they can’t afford it. EpiPens are a perfect example of a health care nightmare. They’re also just a typical example of the dysfunction of the American health care system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5780,23826,Simple Rules for Healthy Eating - The New York Times,New York Times,Aaron E. Carroll,12/28/2015,2015,12,,"Over the past few months, I’ve written a number of times on how nutrition recommendations are seldom supported by science. I’ve argued that what many people are telling you may be inaccurate. In response, many of you have asked me what nutrition recommendations should say. It’s much easier, unfortunately, to tell you what not to do. But here at The Upshot, we don’t avoid the hard questions. So I’m going to put myself on the line. Below are the general rules I live by. They’re the ones I share with patients, with friends and with family. They’re the ones I support as a pediatrician and a health services researcher. But I acknowledge up front that they may apply only to healthy people without metabolic disorders (me, for instance, as far as I know). These suggestions are also not supported by the scientific weight of rigorous randomized controlled trials, because little in nutrition is. I’ve inserted links to back them up with the available evidence. They are not “laws” and should not be treated as such. No specific nutrients will be demonized, and none will be held up as miracles. But these recommendations make sense to me, and they’ve helped me immensely. Full disclosure: I did not invent most of these. I’ve developed them from reading the work of others, including what may be the most impressive “official” nutritional guidelines, those of Brazil, as well as from earlier suggestions from readers, as in this great NYT interactive graphic. It captures readers’ responses to food rules by Michael Pollan. He is, of course, the promulgator of the   advice: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. ” 1. Get as much of your nutrition as possible from a variety of completely unprocessed foods. These include fruits and vegetables. But they also include meat, fish, poultry and eggs that haven’t been processed. In other words, when buying food at the market, focus on things that have not been been cooked, prepared or altered in any way. Brown rice over white rice. Whole grains over refined grains. You’re far better off eating two apples than drinking the same 27 grams of sugar in an   glass of apple juice. 1b. Eat lightly processed foods less often. You’re not going to make everything yourself. Pasta, for instance, is going to be bought already prepared. You’re not going to grind your own flour or extract your own oil. These are meant to be eaten along with unprocessed foods, but try to eat less of them. 1c. Eat heavily processed foods even less often. There’s little   evidence that even the most processed foods are dangerous. But keep your consumption of them to a minimum, because they can make it too easy to stuff in calories. Such foods include bread, chips, cookies and cereals. In epidemiologic studies, heavily processed meats are often associated with worse health outcomes, but that evidence should be taken with a grain of salt (not literally) as I’ve written about before. 2. Eat as much   food as possible, which should be prepared according to Rule 1. Eating at home allows you to avoid processed ingredients more easily. It allows you full control over what you eat, and allows you to choose the flavors you prefer. You’re much less likely to stuff yourself silly if you eat   food. I’m not saying this is easy. Behavioral change takes repetition and practice. It also, unfortunately, takes time. 3. Use salt and fats, including butter and oil, as needed in food preparation.  Things like salt and fat aren’t the enemy. They are often necessary in the preparation of tasty, satisfying food. The key here is moderation. Use what you need. Seasoning is often what makes vegetables taste good. Don’t be afraid of them, but don’t go crazy with them either. 4. When you do eat out, try to eat at restaurants that follow the same rules. Ideally, you should eat at restaurants that are creating all of their items from completely unprocessed foods. Lots and lots of restaurants do. Follow Rule 1 even while out to dinner. Some processing is going to be fine, but try to keep it to a minimum. 5. Drink mostly water, but some alcohol, coffee and other beverages are fine. As I’ve pointed out before, you can find a study to show that everything either prevents or causes cancer  —   alcohol and coffee included. But my take is that the preponderance of evidence supports the inclusion of a moderate consumption of most beverages. 6. Treat all beverages with calories in them as you would alcohol. This includes every drink with calories, including milk. They’re fine in moderation, but keep them to a minimum. You can have them because you like them, but you shouldn’t consume them as if you need them. 7. Eat with other people, especially people you care about, as often as possible. This has benefits even outside those of nutrition. It will make you more likely to cook. It will most likely make you eat more slowly. It will also make you happy. I’ve avoided treating any food like the devil. Many nutrition experts do, and it may turn out they’re right, but at this point I think the jury is still out. I’ve therefore tried not to tell you to avoid anything completely. My experience tells me that total abstinence rarely works, although anecdotes exist to support that practice. I think you’ll find that many other diets and recommendations work under these rules. These are much more flexible and, I hope, reasonable than what some might prescribe. All of these rules are subtly trying to get you to be more conscious of what you’re eating. It’s far too easy these days to consume more than you think you are, or more than you really need, especially when eating out. I’ve found that it’s impossible to tell any one person how much they should be eating. People have varying requirements, and it’s important for all of them to listen to their bodies to know when they should eat, and when they should stop. One other thing: Don’t judge what others eat. One of my closest friends has been avoiding carbohydrates for months, and has seen remarkable results. Another was a pescatarian  —   a person whose only meat dishes are fish  —   for a year and was very happy with that. I, on the other hand, avoid no food groups in particular. People are very different. Some may have real problems consuming even the smallest amount of carbohydrates. Others may be intolerant of certain foods because of allergies or sensitivities. It will most likely take a bit of experimentation, on an individual level, to find the actual diet within these recommendations that works for you. But the above rules should allow for a wide variety of foods and for remaining healthy. At least, I hope so. I’m curious what readers think of these. I welcome your comments to this column, as well as tweets to me in response.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6765,25139,"Drink to Your Health (in Moderation), the Science Says - The New York Times",New York Times,Aaron E. Carroll,12/22/2015,2015,12,,"Over the past year, I’ve tried to clear up a lot of the misconceptions on food and drink: about salt, artificial sweeteners, among others, even water. Now let me take on alcohol: wine, beer and cocktails. Although I have written about the dangerous effects of alcohol abuse and misuse, that doesn’t mean it’s always bad. A part of many complex and delicious adult beverages, alcohol is linked to a number of health benefits in medical studies. That doesn’t mean the studies provide only good news, either, or that the evidence in its favor is a slam dunk. You won’t be surprised to hear that, once again, my watchword  —   moderation  —   applies. Research into how alcohol consumption affects health has been going on for a long time. A 1990 prospective cohort study included results of more than 275, 000 men followed since 1959. Compared with those who never drank alcohol, those who consumed one to two drinks a day had a significantly reduced mortality rate from both coronary heart disease and “all causes. ” Those who consumed three or more drinks a day still had a lower risk of death from coronary heart disease, but had a higher mortality rate over all. A 2004 study came to similar conclusions. It followed about 6, 600 men and 8, 000 women for five years and found that compared with those who drank about one drink a day on average, those who didn’t drink at all and those who drank more than two drinks a day had higher rates of death. Results like these have been consistent across a number of studies in different populations. Even studies published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research agree that moderate drinking seems to be associated with a decreased risk of death over all. However, alcohol seems to have different effects on different diseases. Almost all of the major benefits of drinking are seen in cardiovascular illnesses. In fact, with men, even consumption of a surprisingly large amount can seem protective. When it comes to cancer, the picture isn’t as rosy. For instance, a 2007 study involving the Women’s Health Study cohort found that increased alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. More broadly, a 2014 systematic review of epidemiologic and experimental studies looking at alcohol and breast cancer found that the overall consensus is that each additional drink per day increases the relative risk (comparing the risk in two groups) of breast cancer by a statistically significant, but small, 2 percent  —   although not the absolute risk. A   of colorectal cancer and alcohol found that heavy drinkers, but not light or moderate drinkers, were at increased risk of the disease. No relationship is seen with respect to bladder cancer or ovarian cancer. A study that included all cancers found that light drinking was protective moderate drinking had no effect and heavy drinking was detrimental. Moderate alcohol consumption has been found to be associated with other benefits, though. A cohort of about 6, 000 people followed in Britain found that those who consumed alcohol at least once a week had significantly better cognitive function in middle age than those who did not drink at all. This protective effect on cognition was seen in people who drank up to 30 drinks a week. A 2004 systematic review found that moderate drinking was associated with up to 56 percent lower rates of diabetes compared with nondrinkers. Heavy drinkers, though, had an increased incidence of diabetes. This is where savvy readers should be asking: What about randomized controlled trials? After all, epidemiologic evidence and associations only go so far they cannot get us to causation. Recently, in Annals of Internal Medicine, such a trial was published. Patients with   Type 2 diabetes were randomized to drink 150 milliliters of water, white wine or red wine with dinner for two years. The beverages were provided to patients free of charge. They were all placed on a Mediterranean diet with no calorie restrictions. Researchers found that those who drank the wine, most notably red wine, had a reduction in cardiometabolic risk factors, or those for heart disease, diabetes or stroke. This was especially true in patients who had certain genotypes. Further, no one had any significant adverse effects from being randomized to drink the alcohol. In another analysis of that  randomized control trial published this year, the most interesting finding was about blood pressure. In this study, some people saw a reduction in systolic blood pressure. Again, the alcohol was not associated with significant adverse effects. This contradicts the findings from systematic reviews of epidemiologic studies that show alcohol intake may be associated with a small but significant increase in blood pressure. Adding further complications was a   trial looking at red wine consumption that found it had no effect, positive or negative, on blood pressure in patients with atherosclerosis. A different analysis of that study found that it did result in improved cholesterol levels, even though many patients were already being treated with statins. A 2011   examined 63 controlled trials of wine, beer and spirits, and found that all of those beverages increased levels of HDL cholesterol (the good cholesterol). There was even a   with more alcohol consumed having more of an effect. Synthesizing all this, there seems to be a sizable amount of evidence that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with decreased rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and death. It also seems to be associated with increased rates, perhaps to a lesser extent, of some cancers, especially breast cancer, as well as some other diseases or conditions. The gains from improved cardiovascular disease deaths seem to outweigh all of the losses in other diseases combined. The most recent report of the U. S. D. A. Scientific Advisory Panel agrees with that assessment. But alcohol isn’t harmless. Many people with certain diseases or disorders, and women who are pregnant, need to avoid it. Others who can’t keep their consumption to acceptable levels need to abstain. Alcohol is very harmful when abused, so much so that it’s difficult for me to tell people to start drinking for their health. That’s rarely the conclusion of any studies about alcohol, no matter how positive the results. Nor is it the advice any doctors I know give. However, the evidence does seem to say that moderate consumption is safe, and that it may even be healthy for many people. If you’re enjoying some drinks this holiday season, it’s nice to know that they may be doing more than just bringing you cheer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6951,25392,"I’m a Doctor. If I Drop Food on the Kitchen Floor, I Still Eat It. - The New York Times",New York Times,Aaron E. Carroll,10/18/2016,2016,10,,"You may have read or heard about the study debunking the   rule. It said that no matter how fast you pick up food that falls on the floor, you will pick up bacteria with it. Our continued focus on this threat has long baffled me. Why are we so worried about the floor? So many other things are more dangerous than that. I first became interested in the   rule years ago, when I was a   of a book on medical myths. We cited a number of studies showing that food that touched household surfaces  —   even for brief periods of time  —   could pick up bacteria or other harmful substances. This most recent study was similar in that it tested a variety of foods, a variety of substances, for various periods. And, like those other studies, this one found that food touching the floor, even for a very short amount of time, could pick up bacteria. There’s no magic period of time that prevents transmission. But even though I know bacteria can accumulate in less than five seconds, I will still eat food that has fallen on my kitchen floor. Why? Because my kitchen floor isn’t really that dirty. Our metric shouldn’t be whether there are more than zero bacteria on the floor. It should be how many bacteria are on the floor compared with other household surfaces. And in that respect, there are so many places in your house that pose more of a concern than the floor. Perhaps no one in the United States has spent more time investigating the occurrence of bacteria on public surfaces than Charles Gerba. He’s a professor of microbiology and environmental sciences at the University of Arizona, and he has published many papers on the subject. In 1998, he and his colleagues investigated how well cleaning products could reduce coliform bacteria counts on household surfaces. As part of that research, they measured various locations in the house before any cleaning. They found that the kitchen floor was likely to harbor, on average, about three colonies per square inch of coliform bacteria (2. 75 to be exact). So there are some. But here’s the thing  —   that’s cleaner than both the refrigerator handle (5. 37 colonies per square inch) and the kitchen counter (5. 75 colonies per square inch). We spend so much time worrying about what food might have picked up from the floor, but we don’t worry about touching the refrigerator. We also don’t seem as worried about food that touches the counter. But the counter is just as dirty, if not dirtier. The same thing happens in the bathroom. I know a lot of people who are worried about the toilet seat, but it’s cleaner than all the things in the kitchen I just mentioned (0. 68 colonies per square inch). What’s dirtier in the bathroom? Almost everything. The flush handle (34. 65 colonies per square inch) the sink faucet (15. 84 colonies per square inch) and the counter (1. 32 colonies per square inch). Things get dirty when lots of hands touch them and when we don’t think about it. We worry about the floor and the toilet seat, so we clean them more. We don’t think about the refrigerator handle or the faucet handle as much. If we carry this logic out further, there are things we handle a lot and never really clean. One study, for instance, found that about 95 percent of mobile phones carried by health care workers were contaminated with nosocomial bacteria. Of those contaminated with staph aureus, more than half were contaminated with methicillin resistant bacteria (MRSA). Think about how many people have handled the money in your wallet. A study of   bills found that 94 percent were colonized by bacteria, 7 percent of which were pathogenic to healthy people and 87 percent of which were pathogenic to people who were hospitalized or who had compromised immune systems. Where do you keep your money? In a wallet or purse? When did you last clean it? It’s probably filthy. I see people pay for food every day and then eat what they’re handed with no concern that the food might have been contaminated. And the money and the hands that just held it could be much dirtier than the floor. There are so many studies out there showing that things we touch every day are so, so dirty. Gas pump handles. A. T. M. buttons. Remote controls. Light switches. Computer keyboards. The dirtiest thing in your kitchen, by far, is likely to be the sponge you keep near the sink. Most people almost never wash or disinfect those sponges. Mr. Gerba found they had, on average, more than 20 million colonies per square inch. All of this should remind you that it’s always a good idea to wash your hands before you eat.   is still one of the best ways to prevent illness. People react to news like this in one of two ways. One is to become paranoid about everything. Such people start to clean compulsively, worry about all the things they’re touching, and use hand sanitizer obsessively. The alternative is to realize that for most of us, our immune systems are pretty hardy. We’ve all been touching this dirty stuff for a long time, without knowing it, and doing just fine. I clearly fall into the latter group. If I drop food on the floor, I still eat it. I do that because the harm I might get from the floor is not worth my concern compared with many, many other things. You may feel differently. Either way, make an informed judgment based on relative risks, not on any arbitrary span of time that one thing has been touching another.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7665,26343,Let’s Say Obamacare Is Repealed. What Then? - The New York Times,New York Times,Aaron E. Carroll and Austin Frakt,4/19/2017,2017,4,,"The election of Donald J. Trump gives the Republicans in Congress a chance to act on their   desire to get rid of Obamacare, a wish that Mr. Trump mostly says he shares. Aaron E. Carroll and Austin Frakt, the health policy analysts for The Upshot, discuss: Then what? Aaron: I think it’s safe to say few in Congress thought they would have this opportunity. But like the proverbial dog who has finally caught the car, after untold futile attempts, Republicans have finally come within reach of repealing the Affordable Care Act. Now comes the essential question: Will they actually do it? They’ve been promising it forever, but I am still skeptical that it will happen. I believe you disagree. I’m going to let you go first. Why do you think they’ll do it? Austin: I think they’ll do it because they so thoroughly own the idea of repeal, having passed bills to repeal, partly repeal, delay or defund the A. C. A. in the House something like 60 times. Just the other day Senator Mitch McConnell endorsed repeal (again). The House and Senate also agreed to do so, in large part, in a budget reconciliation bill earlier this year. The only thing that prevented it was that President Obama vetoed it. I doubt Mr. Trump would do the same if given a similar opportunity. Now, I know that a budget reconciliation dismantling of the law is not a full repeal, because according to the rules it can only touch   provisions. This excludes things like requiring insurers to take all comers for premiums that vary only by age and smoking status or preventing them from imposing coverage caps and lifetime limits, among other measures. I also must add that I’m much less confident of a repeal (or partial repeal) without agreement on a replacement. But I’ll turn it back to you, Aaron. Do you think the G. O. P. has to offer a full replacement to get its members to sign on to repeal? Or can it offer something that would cover fewer people and with fewer benefits? Aaron: I think they can get away with slightly fewer people and somewhat skimpier benefits, but not too much. There’s a part of me that thinks many in Congress were always so willing to vote for a “repeal” because they knew it had no chance of being signed into law. They got credit for the vote without ever having to face the downside. Actually repealing without replacing would mean effectively stripping more than 20 million people of their health insurance, without anything in return. This would be an unmitigated political disaster. The stories  —   of people with cancer, diabetes and more who were suddenly stripped of their insurance and left out in the cold  —   would very likely dominate our discussion for months. That leaves more than enough time to lead to significant repercussions in the 2018 midterm elections. With no Democratic leaders in any branch of government to blame, I think this would be akin to what happened in the 2010 elections, but in reverse. Now, if they can coalesce around a “replace” plan that doesn’t leave too many people out, then I think they could move forward. But in all the years since the A. C. A. was passed, Republicans haven’t been able to do that. Do you think they can? What do you think that plan would look like? Austin: One way to get from repeal to replace that minimizes immediate political risk is to pass a plan that doesn’t call for repeal for several years, at least after the 2018 midterms, though possibly after the 2020 election. Between now and then, there would need to be some kind of transition to whatever replaces Obamacare that didn’t just dump people off coverage with no alternative. But the alternatives could just be not as comprehensive or costly. Absolutely there will be bad stories. But keep in mind, there will be bad stories under Obamacare, too. Rocketing premiums, huge cost sharing and markets with few choices is not a recipe for political success. Republicans now own the task of fixing those things and doing so in a way that does not look as if they’re making Obamacare better. They’re actually in a tough policy spot. They’ll get the blame if they don’t fix or repeal the A. C. A. and they’ll get the blame if they don’t replace it with something people like better. Health policy is a very difficult and thankless task. I think they’ll opt for something they can call repeal and replace, but they could also just let Obamacare struggle and die. Neither looks good. One other way to get out from under the issue is to kick it to the states. Do you think a Trump administration, working with a G. O. P. Congress, will offer greater flexibility to states to design their own coverage plans that could diverge from Obamacare? If so, what are some ideas states might try? Aaron: I think it’s very likely those in Congress could punt Medicaid to the states. For years, they’ve been trying to change Medicaid funding to a block grant that they can then constrain over time. This will be enticing for them because it will allow them to reduce Medicaid spending in the future, while forcing states to make the tough decisions  —   and take the blame  —   for cuts in either beneficiaries or services. Fixing the markets for those who are getting health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges, though, is a different story. Without some sort of market regulation, which they’ve generally been opposed to, the same problems that existed  . C. A. with respect to   conditions and individual ratings will exist. Many people will become uninsured. Annual and lifetime limits could reappear. Lots of people will have problems getting insured. Moreover, I have yet to be convinced that a significant number of Republicans in the House might coalesce around such a plan. Maybe for Medicaid, but I’m not sure about the exchanges. Even if they could, it’s likely the Democrats in the Senate would try to filibuster either of these plans. Don’t you think? Austin: Yes, I think Democrats would filibuster anything they could. The filibuster is not set in stone. A Senate majority can change it, and some are already calling for the G. O. P. to do so. But that doesn’t appear to be what the Senate will do  —   they’ll retain the filibuster. This could play to their favor, since they can propose things they like, let the Democrats filibuster them and take the blame when repeal kicks in with no replacement. Perhaps that’s another way for Republicans to get out of their political bind. Aaron: I’m sure we’ll have more to discuss as President Trump’s administration comes into power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8087,26823,Tripp - If I Had Leaked To Drudge Clinton Might Have Been Removed From Presidency,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,2/28/2017,2017,2,,"During a radio interview, Linda Tripp, once the chief cooperating witness to the Independent Counsel probing whether Bill Clinton committed impeachable offenses, said that she deeply regrets not leaking details about various Clinton scandals to Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport. com. [She explained that leaking to Drudge may have resulted in a different outcome for the impeachment investigation, which was led by   Counsel Kenneth Starr, possibly leading to Clinton’s removal from office.  She was speaking on this reporter’s Sunday night talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. Tripp stated: “As a cooperating witness, and at that point I was the chief cooperating witness, I didn’t even question abiding by their requirements. That I speak to no one. That I was solely and one hundred percent their witness. Since I believed they had the intention of unearthing all of the scandal and all of the corruption that I had witnessed I was eager and willing to do so. ” She explained that leaking to Drudge may have changed the course of the impeachment probe: What I regret now in retrospect was allowing the entire media during that time and the Clinton machine in concert to define not only me but the Independent Counsel and everyone else as being the bad guys. I should have been leaking to Drudge on a daily basis. He was the only one at that point trying to get out the truth. The only entity trying to get out the truth. The rest of the media, their aim at that point was to cover the story, yes.  But to find a way to make Bill Clinton the victim. And to do that they needed to essentially vilify me and anyone, including the Independent Counsel, that would dare go after him. So yeah, I regret not going to Drudge. I think the whole story would have had a different outcome had I done that. Tripp explained that she fully cooperated with the Independent Counsel, serving at once point as the chief cooperating witness, because she believed the investigation would expand its probe into other alleged Clinton misdeeds beyond the issue of whether the president lied under oath about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.  Instead, the impeachment investigation zeroed in on the Lewinsky issue only  —   on one account of perjury and another on obstruction of justice. Clinton was impeached in the House but the Senate did not reach the   majority vote required for impeachment. Tripp’s front row seat during her White House days afforded her access to some inside stories on the scandals known as Travelgate, Filegate and Whitewater, and she says she personally witnessed the handling of documents from Vince Foster’s office the morning after the Deputy White House Counsel was found dead in an apparent suicide. During the Clinton administration, Tripp first served as support staff to the Immediate Office of the President, where she sat just outside Bill Clinton’s Oval Office. After three months, Tripp was asked to work for the White House Counsel’s office as executive assistant to White House Counsel Bernie Nussbaum, who played a lead role in defending the Clintons for their infamous alleged misdeeds.  Tripp’s office was located adjacent to Hillary Clinton’s. In an interview with this reporter last October, Dave Schippers, who served as the Chief Investigative Counsel for the House Judiciary Committee’s probe into whether Clinton committed impeachable offenses, also revealed that he wanted the focus to expand beyond the Lewinsky issue. Schippers alleged that outside forces put the brakes on the expansion of the probe: When we started our investigation, Henry Hyde said, “How wide do you want to go?” And I said, “Get us an open investigation. We have so many things that we want to investigate. ” And we got an open investigation where we were permitted to investigate as far as whatever came up in the impeachment inquiry. Immediately after the 1998 election, the leadership in the House put the brakes on. We had a meeting and Henry Hyde said the House has told us that we’ve got Monica Lewinsky and we can go no further. We are not permitted to do any additional investigation. And I said, “My God, we’ve got at least three murders and other things that we are going into. ” And he says, “I’m sorry we can’t do it. ” Schippers described the room at the Ford House Office Building where the evidence was housed during the impeachment probe as having armed guards outside. He said those who were permitted to enter were not allowed to bring anything in or out. He said he was one of the few people who actually reviewed all of the evidence in the impeachment case. He added that only 65 House members accepted an invitation to review the evidence in the room and that all senators declined before they voted against impeaching Clinton. Asked about the specifics of the evidence, Schippers said he was barred from answering the question. However, he replied, “Let me say this.   Congressmen saw that evidence. And 64 voted to impeach.

8224,26960,Jordan Blames Israel for ‘Ugly Crime’ of Killing Terrorist in Midst of Stabbing - Breitbart,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,5/13/2017,2017,5,,"JERUSALEM  —   Instead of condemning a terrorist attack carried out by a Jordanian citizen right outside Jerusalem’s Old City on Saturday, the Kingdom of Jordan blamed Israel for the “ugly crime” of an Israeli policeman defending himself by shooting the Jordanian assailant as the officer was being repeatedly and brutally stabbed. [Jerusalem Police Spokeswoman Luba Simri explained the policeman was walking down a street near the Lion’s Gate, an entrance to the Old City, when the officer was stabbed in the face and body by the Jordanian citizen,    Mohammed Abdullah Salim  .  “The terrorist rushed toward him, whipped out a knife that he had in his possession, stormed him and began stabbing him. The police officer responded with determination and in a professional manner, managed to activate his weapon and neutralized the terrorist,” Simri told reporters. A second policeman was stabbed in the hand while helping to subdue the terrorist, who reportedly entered Israel several days ago. The Israeli police released graphic video of the attack (watch it below) in which Kasaji can clearly be seen repeatedly stabbing the policeman, who had been knocked to the floor.  Jordan’s Foreign Ministry in Tel Aviv described the attack as an “ugly crime. ” Jordan was referring to the policeman’s   and not to the reportedly unprovoked terrorist attack by one of its own citizens. Jordan’s Minister of Communications Muhammad  ’man was quoted as saying, “The Israeli government, as the occupying power in Jerusalem, bears responsibility for the shooting of a Jordanian civilian who was killed. ” Mu’man failed to note that the terrorist, Kasaji, was killed while stabbing the officer. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the Jordanian statements. “It is time that Jordan ceases its double sided game. Just as Israel condemns terror attacks in Jordan, Jordan must condemn terrorist attacks in Israel. Terror is terror,” Netanyahu said. The Times of Israel further reported on today’s terrorist attack: The    police officer was taken to Jerusalem’s Shaare Tzedek Medical Center in moderate condition after the incident near the Lions’ Gate. He had wounds in the neck and head, and was conscious and in stable condition when evacuated to the hospital. A second man was lightly wounded, with cuts to the hand.   …    After the incident police arrested a local merchant who they suspected prevented   from helping the policeman during the attack.

8318,27054,Flashback - Reports: Obama Campaign Opened Back Channel to Iran - Breitbart,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,5/27/2017,2017,5,,"TEL AVIV  —   Amid reports that President Trump’s    and senior adviser Jared Kushner allegedly talked with Russia’s envoy to the U. S. about setting up a back channel for communications, it may be instructive to recall that representatives for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign reportedly established a back channel with Iran. [The Washington Post, which broke the story about Kushner, cited communications from Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak to Moscow allegedly intercepted by U. S. intelligence officials. Russian diplomats are known to deliberately place misinformation in communications they believe are being monitored, the Post noted, allowing for the possibility that Kushner never actually asked for a back channel.  ABC News quoted two sources as saying the purported back channel that Kushner and Kislyak were allegedly discussing was supposed to focus on policy issues, including the war in Syria where Russia is highly influential. In August 2014, Michael Ledeen, a former consultant to the National Security Council and U. S. Defense Department, penned a column at PJ Media stating Obama opened a   to Iran during the 2008 presidential campaign. Ledeen said the back channel went through retired Ambassador William G. Miller, who also led the 1979 negotiating mission during the Iran hostage crisis. Ladeen wrote that Miller confirmed his   involvement to him. Ledeen wrote: (emphasis added by this reporter) The actual strategy is detente first, and then a full alliance with Iran throughout the Middle East and North Africa. It has been on display since before the beginning of the Obama administration. During his first presidential campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama used a secret back channel to Tehran to assure the mullahs that he was a friend of the Islamic Republic, and that they would be very happy with his policies. The secret channel was Ambassador William G. Miller, who served in Iran during the shah’s rule, as chief of staff for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and as ambassador to Ukraine.

8383,27119,EXCLUSIVE – Mike Huckabee to Trump: Ignore Detractors and Move U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem  ,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,5/22/2017,2017,5,,"JERUSALEM  —   Speaking to Breitbart News during a trip to Israel, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee hailed President Donald Trump’s historic trip to Israel and urged the president to fulfil his campaign promise to move the U. S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem despite pressure against such a move. [“I think this is a historic trip,” said Huckabee. “He made the first ever flight from Riyadh to Tel Aviv. We had the first sitting U. S. president go to the Western Wall and offer a prayer. I think that is incredibly significant. ”  Huckabee said that Trump has been “very vocal in his support for Israel and I think that the people here sense it. ” Continued Huckabee: I also hope with all my heart that he will keep his campaign promise to move the U. S. embassy. I know there is enormous pressure for him not to do that. The rationale is that it will make certain people unhappy. Whoever those people are, they are unhappy already. They are not going to be made happy by the location of the U. S. embassy. Huckabee said Trump’s visits to Israel and Saudi Arabia have demonstrated that a “very strong America is much better than a weak America. This is so incredibly different from the eight years of Barack Obama’s administration. ” “The reception that Trump received in Saudi Arabia was a stunning contrast to the one received by Barack Obama,” he continued. “In Obama, they [the Saudis] saw a weak American leader, whereas with Trump they see someone who exhibits strength. Whose strength in leadership is out front. They might not have agreed with everything that Trump said [in his address in Saudi Arabia] but they have to respect that he spoke the truth. ” Huckabee, who ran against Trump in the 2016 presidential election before endorsing him, is in Israel on a brief tour with   American activist Dr. Joseph Frager. On Sunday night, Huckabee and Frager went for a nighttime visit to Joseph’s Tomb, Judaism’s third holiest site, located in a complex controlled by the Palestinian Authority. “It’s an amazing experience to have to come to this type of difficulty just to be able to come to a holy site for Jews and frankly even for Christians, who pay tribute to Joseph,” Huckabee said at the site, according to Ynetnews. “To have to do it in the dead of night, under armed guard, with the smell of tear gas in the air, burning tires along the route, it’s a stark reminder [of how different] it is in the heart of Israel, where the Israeli government protects every Muslim that accesses their holy site,” he added. “In Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] Jewish people do not have unhindered access to holy sites without having to go to extraordinary lengths in order to be able to access these places. ” Huckabee will also attend the annual Moskowitz Prize for Zionism reception. The prize was “established in recognition of the people who put Zionism into action in today’s Israeli society  —   at times risking their own personal security, placing the collective before personal needs and doing what it takes to ensure a strong, secure Jewish homeland. ” It was established by the late   Irving Moskowitz, whose wife Cherna continues the family’s philanthropy. U. S. law requires the relocation of the embassy to Jerusalem. However, President Obama signed successive waivers delaying the move. The current waiver expires on June 1. Numerous reports in recent days cited White House officials saying that Trump is not expected to use the visit to announce an embassy move. Still, that prediction is subject to change. Even if Trump does not announce an embassy move, there are   that could be put into place, including the possibility of David Friedman, the U. S. ambassador to Israel, setting up shop at the U. S. consulate in Jerusalem instead of the beachfront embassy building in Tel Aviv. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

8476,27212,EXCLUSIVE - Linda Tripp: SNL Made Me into A ‘Villain’,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,2/26/2017,2017,2,,"During a radio interview broadcast on Sunday, Linda Tripp, who was famously portrayed by John Goodman on Saturday Night Live during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, blasted SNL for what she described as a political campaign to “make me into a villain” instead of Bill and Hillary Clinton. [Tripp says she was prompted to go public about the issue in response to the NBC comedy sketch show’s negative portrayal of President Donald Trump and top White House officials. She charged the show and the mainstream news media were engaged in a deliberate “campaign of disinformation, confusion, and essentially propaganda. ”  Tripp also opened up about the personal toll she said the media’s negative portrayal had on her, describing how she banned television from her house for three years in the late 1990’s and at times engaged in binge eating as a coping mechanism. She was speaking on this reporter’s weekend talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s Am 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. In the interview, Tripp divulged she has been quietly writing a book about her experiences working directly adjacent to Hillary Clinton’s second floor West Wing office, where Tripp was afforded a front row seat into some of the most infamous scandals to rock the Clinton White House, misdeeds that she says partially prompted her to finally go public about the Lewinsky affair.  She explained she was also motivated to go public to protect Lewinsky. SNL ‘Had an Agenda’ During the Clinton administration, Tripp first served as support staff to the Immediate Office of the President, where she sat just outside Bill Clinton’s Oval Office. After three months, Tripp was asked to work for the White House Counsel’s office as executive assistant to White House Counsel Bernie Nussbaum, who played a lead role in defending the Clintons for their infamous alleged misdeeds.  Tripp’s office was located adjacent to Hillary Clinton’s. Tripp documented evidence of Lewinsky’s phone calls about her relationship with Bill Clinton and submitted the evidence to independent counsel Kenneth Starr, leading to the public disclosure of the affair. Throughout the scandal, SNL repeatedly depicted Tripp, played by Goodman, as a wrongdoer who betrayed her friend by recording conversations with the younger Lewinsky in a bid to land a book deal, even though Tripp never published a book. In a previous interview on my show, Tripp explained she went public because she believed her own life and Lewinsky’s were in danger, saying that Lewinsky was threatening Clinton with outing the relationship. During our interview on Sunday, Tripp commented on the SNL portrayals of her. “I had always been a great fan of John Goodman,” Tripp said. “I think he is funny. And actually, in the beginning I thought his portrayal was funny. But over time, I came to realize that there was more there than comedy alone. ” Tripp recalled SNL comedian Dana Carvey “did just amazing impersonations of President Bush. But it was just good clean fun. Much the way you saw Obama portrayed on Saturday Night Live. ” “And this was different,” she said, referring the show’s portrayal of her.  “It had an agenda. It had a focus. And it was a means to an end. And the means to an end was to use any and all opportunities to discredit and to vilify me.   …     What happened to me and what is happening today frankly is something completely different and scary. ” Tripp continued: “Many people don’t know this, but as soon as the (Lewinsky) story broke, Hillary Clinton is documented as saying, ‘Get me anything and everything on Linda Tripp.’ Which I knew she would do. They couldn’t discredit me professionally because they had promoted me many times over the time that I was in the White House. So, they were lost on that score. So, they had to make me into a villain. ” She took issue with the show’s framing of her as the offender. “Quite apart from being a betrayer, I believe I helped Monica Lewinsky. But the real issue is how the Clinton machine in conjunction with the media portrayed me as evil repeatedly. And frankly I don’t present well photographically so I helped them. ” Tripp subsequently said she found it interesting that liberals espouse “hollow claims to champion civil rights of all, want the federal government to assign gender neutral bathrooms, but were okay with SNL portraying me as a transgender villain. Their PC protections only apply to liberals. ” Media Coverage of Trump ‘A Sabotage of the Truth’ Meanwhile, Tripp said during Sunday’s interview that she sees SNL’s current negative portrayal of Trump and top administration officials, including Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway and White House Spokesman Sean Spencer, as part of a larger news media campaign aimed at discrediting the president and his policies. “Now I think what is going on on SNL is a part of it,” she said. “It’s all of a piece, though. It’s almost a psychological warfare tactic. I worked with special operations for many years. And I can’t overstate the effectiveness of this campaign that they are waging. “You have to understand that the media backed one candidate. And after she was defeated and after a campaign where the   mainstream media, which is a true misnomer, advocated essentially as an arm of the DNC. After her defeat, they have done nothing but double down in an attempt to take down what they perceive as their opponent. Because he had the nerve to actually win. When, if you will recall, virtually everyone in the mainstream media laughed on air about even the possibility of his winning. ” Tripp called the rampant   media coverage a “campaign of disinformation, confusion, and essentially propaganda. ” “It is a sabotage of the truth. And it’s on a grand scale. And for me it is painful to watch because even though the president has a bully pulpit, even he is at the mercy of what people refer to as the mainstream media. A private citizen has no chance. But even the president will face obstacles because this is an orchestrated effort. ” Mocking Took a Personal Toll, Tripp described how SNL’s mocking and the larger negative coverage in the news media caused her to go into hiding, created body image issues, and led to binge eating as a coping mechanism. “I know that I went into hiding,” she stated.  “I know that I have never been a vain person. I kind of have always been a pretty straightforward person. I have never obsessed about my looks. I guess I have never been that much of a girly girl. So, I was stunned at how I looked number one in the pictures. ” “Realizing that I had deteriorated in such an extreme way in my years following my exposure to the Clintons. And that is kind of how I cope. I eat myself into oblivion and it shows when I can’t deal on any level with what I am seeing. “I took TVs out of my house. We didn’t have TV in my house for a good three years. Because I couldn’t bear to see all the negativity and all the untruths. And it was a helpless feeling because as a private citizen you have virtually no chance at all to defend yourself. They can create the monster that they choose to create. And you are literally helpless to combat that. ” One of many examples of SNL’s targeting of Tripp was a skit jeering Tripp’s February 1999 interview with   reporter Jamie Gangel. In the skit, the mock Gangel stated: “Miss Tripp, no one understands, no one. No one understands why you did what you did. You betrayed your friend by taping private current phone conversations. ” Tripp’s character, played by Goodman, replied, “I don’t want to talk about that. Not because I think it was a horrible, gutless, soulless thing to do but apparently, it’s against the law in the state of Maryland. And they want to prosecute me for it. Big time. ” “Do you feel bad about what you have done?” asked Gangel’s character. “What have I done?” Goodman replies, as Tripp. “You went out of your way to betray a friend’s confidence. To end a relationship between two consenting adults and in the process caused an investigation that cost the American taxpayer tens of millions of dollars all in the hopes of getting a book deal. ” “Well,” retorted Tripp’s character, “if you put it that way no. I did what I did because I’m a patriot. As a New England Patriot. I’m their new starting outside linebacker. ” Far from that characterization, Tripp said on Sunday she documented evidence of Lewinsky’s phone calls in order to help Lewinsky. Speaking last September on my show, Tripp made similar remarks. She stated at the time: I say today and I will continue to say that I believe Monica Lewinsky is alive today because of choices I made and action I took. That may sound melodramatic to your listeners. I can only say that from my perspective I believe that she and I at the time were in danger, because nothing stands in the way of these people achieving their political ends. I think that had it not become public when it did, particularly in light of the Paula Jones lawsuit, which was coming to a head with President Clinton’s deposition, that we may well have met with an accident. It’s a situation where unless you lived it as I did you would have no real framework of reference for this sort of situation. Book, Tripp revealed during the interview that she has been working on a book for the past five years. Besides the Lewinsky issue, her front row seat during her White House days afforded her access to some inside stories on the scandals known as Travelgate, Filegate and Whitewater, and she says she personally witnessed the handling of documents from Vince Foster’s office the morning after the Deputy White House Counsel was found dead in an apparent suicide. Tripp stated the book would contain her “version of what happened and what caused me to go forward and the motivation that propelled me forward in the face of overwhelming obstacles. ” “I mean you just do not go up against the president of the United States for frivolous reasons,” she said. “Certainly, not for a book. I do think it may be time to put it out in the public domain. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

8515,27251,Suspected Palestinian Car-Ramming Attack Targets Israelis at Bus Stop,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,1/25/2017,2017,1,,"TEL AVIV  —   A Palestinian wielding a knife rammed a vehicle into an Israeli bus stop in the West Bank and was shot dead by Israeli forces responding to the attack, the army said. [Israeli civilians waiting at the bus stop were not injured in the attempted attack, according to initial reports.  The Israel Defense Forces released the following statement on the matter, which they sent by text message to Breitbart News and other agencies: A short while ago a Palestinian rammed a vehicle into a bus stop at the entrance to Kokhav Ya’akov,   of Ramallah. No injuries have been reported. In response to the immediate threat, forces fired at the attacker, resulting in his death. A knife was found in the attackers possession. The IDF said it was looking into the incident as a “suspected car attack. ” The Times of Israel has more: According to the military, the driver swerved from his lane and crashed his truck into the metal bollards surrounding a bus stop near the Ma’ale Michmash settlement in the central West Bank.   …    The driver was later identified by the Palestinian health ministry as Hussein Salem Abu Ghosh, 24, from Qalandiya. According to the Ynet news site, Abu Ghosh is the cousin of a terrorist, also named Hussein Abu Ghosh from the Qalandiya refugee camp, who killed    Shlomit Krigman and injured another woman in the Beit Horon settlement exactly one year ago. A video of the aftermath of the attack can be seen below: Following the attempted   a second attack targeted Israeli troops near the village of Aboud, which is close to the scene of the attempted ramming attack. The IDF stated: Shots were fired from a passing vehicle at an IDF post adjacent to the village of Aboud. No injuries were sustained. In response, IDF forces fired towards the gunman, confirming a hit. Upon searching the vehicle, forces found a “Carlo” firearm. The assailant is receiving medical treatment at the scene. The IDF provided Breitbart Jerusalem with an image of the “Carlo” firearm it said was uncovered in the assailant’s vehicle: Earlier this month, a Palestinian carried out a deadly   terrorist attack in Jerusalem, killing four and injuring 13, some seriously. Today’s attempted attack targeting civilians at a bus stop represents what seems to be the continued stepping up of terrorist attacks in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem following last month’s United Nations Security Council   resolution calling the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem “occupied Palestinian territories. ” Israeli defense officials here have also noted a sharp and alarming increase in Palestinian   attacks since the UN resolution. Some of the holiest sites in Judaism are located in eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank, including the Western Wall and Temple Mount in Jerusalem’s Old City the Cave of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs in Hebron, which was home to the oldest continuous Jewish community in the world until the Jews of Hebron were massacred and expelled the Tomb of Rachel in Bethlehem and Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus  —   biblical Shechem.

8529,27265,Newly-Released Clinton Email: Huma Sent ’Secure Document’ While Hillary Did Yoga - Breitbart,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,1/4/2017,2017,1,,"During a March 10, 2015 press conference meant to address the growing controversy surrounding her private email server, Hillary Clinton famously claimed the emails she deleted were “within the scope of my personal privacy”  —   including messages about her yoga routines, family vacations and her daughter Chelsea’s wedding. [On Thursday, the State Department released 371 emails from the batch of about 15, 000 that were reportedly uncovered during an FBI investigation of Clinton’s server.  Among the newly released correspondence was a message about Clinton’s yoga, with the email in question also involving the transmission of a secure document.  The message citing yoga, dated February 12, 2010, was sent to Clinton by her top aide Huma Abedin. Typed in lower case letters, the email stated: “i am going to have the secure document from jake faxed to the house while you do yoga. also, i am getting (redacted) tomorrow in case we land sunday and have to go straight to work right now she is coming at 1 pm. ” Clinton responded, “Ok. Pls have secure stuff faxed to justin. ” “Yes, I connected with him,” Abedin replied. Below is a screenshot grab of the email: Clinton was known to have had a secure fax machine at her house. The newly released email was not necessarily deleted by Clinton. The Hill reported on the most recent batch of released emails from the 15, 000 uncovered by the FBI: Many of the documents  —   consisting of about 1, 031 pages  —   are “near duplicates” of documents Clinton provided to the State Department in 2014 and have already been made public, according to the agency.   …    Clinton deleted about 30, 000 emails from the private server she used while secretary of State, saying they were not   before turning over thousands more to the government. But during its examination, the FBI recovered some additional emails that could be relevant to the FOIA lawsuit. A preliminary review of the 15, 000 emails revealed that about 60 percent were of a purely personal nature. Around 37 percent  —   or 5, 600 documents  —   were deemed   but of those, a “substantial number” were exact duplicates of the 30, 000 emails that Clinton turned over to the agency in December 2014, according to State Department lawyers. This is not the first Clinton email to be made public that involves yoga. A September 3, 2009 email posted on WikiLeaks was titled “Yoga” and contained a list of times  —    seemingly for yoga classes.

8636,27372,EXCLUSIVE – Rep. Ron DeSantis: Trump Should Ignore Palestinian Threats Over Moving Embassy to Jerusalem,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,3/6/2017,2017,3,,"JERUSALEM  —   Speaking from Jerusalem in a Breitbart Jerusalem exclusive interview, Congressman Ron DeSantis ( ) strongly rejected Palestinian threats regarding the possibility of the U. S. moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. [DeSantis, chairman of the subcommittee for National Security for the House Oversight Committee, was in Israel on Saturday and Sunday with a small delegation as part of a   tour to study the possibility of relocating the U. S. Embassy to Jerusalem.  In response to his visit, Ziad Khalil Abu Zayyad, a spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah Party warned, the “US Congress should understand that moving the US embassy to Jerusalem will explode the situation in the Mena region (Middle East and North Africa. ” “This same team should consult with its military and political consultants in the (U. S.) State Department that stated several times in the past that (such) actions put American interests and presence in the region in danger,” Zayyad said. Numerous PA officials in recent weeks made similar statements about the possibility of violence in response to any embassy relocation to Jerusalem. Responding to those threats, DeSantis told this reporter: They say that about if we were to do anything. There is always going to be a pretext for them to use to go on their cycle of violence. As you’ve mentioned, they rejected peace time and time again. So, I think for us to do policy based on what a Palestinian Arab is saying they are going to do in response given their history is unacceptable. The second thing is, I think it would actually be very good for Donald Trump to follow through with his promise. Because I think it will show that this is a guy who means business. That he is exercising leadership. That he is not afraid to take bold action even in the face of these threats. And ultimately in the Arab world they have a different psychology than in the Western World. They respect strength. And they respect a strong horse. So, if you cower in the face of these threats to me you will end up losing respect not only from Palestinian Arabs, but also from some of the Arab states in the Gulf.

8766,27502,How the Obama Administration Was Caught Politicizing Intelligence,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,2/20/2017,2017,2,,"TEL AVIV  —   Amid the   claims about Donald Trump and Russia emanating in recent months from intelligence agencies led by Obama administration appointees, it is instructive to recall the   results of a damning investigation by House Republicans that found Obama’s Defense Department routinely politicized intelligence to fit certain worldviews. [Specifically, the U. S. House of Representatives’ Joint Task Force on U. S. Central Command (CENTCOM) Intelligence Analysis concluded that the intelligence arm of CENTCOM routinely produced intelligence that “distorted, suppressed, or substantially altered” the results of the campaign against the Islamic State.  Much of the   August 10, 2016 House report remains unreported by the news media. The investigation provides insight into the manner in which Obama administration officials were caught reforming one U. S. intelligence agency to produce results that conformed to a political agenda instead of accurately reflecting intelligence information on the ground. The document deserves a revisit amid unsubstantiated claims about Trump and Russia in recent months that have dominated the discourse after they were amplified by Obama administration intelligence agencies. While most of the media minimized the findings of the House report on CENTCOM, this reporter previously reviewed the document in full and presented the ten most troubling finds. Here they are again, in no particular order: 1  —   Top CENTCOM leaders modified intelligence assessments to present an “unduly positive” assessment of combating the Islamic State and training the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). The complaint alleges that senior leaders within the CENTCOM Intelligence Directorate and JIC, including the Director of Intelligence and other senior intelligence staff, violated regulations, tradecraft standards, and professional ethics by modifying intelligence assessments to present an unduly positive outlook on CENTCOM efforts to train the ISF and combat ISIL. Media outlets have also raised allegations of possible reprisals against individuals within the CENTCOM Intelligence Directorate.   …     According to multiple interviewees, operational reporting was used as a justification to alter or “soften” an analytic product so it would cast U. S. efforts in a more positive light. No interview provided any instances where operational reporting was used as a justification to come to a more pessimistic conclusion. Additionally, numerous interviewees indicated that analytical products which conflicted with operational reporting were routinely subject to more stringent scrutiny than those that did not. 2  —   CENTCOM established an intelligence “fusion center” for   intel, but kept out analysts whose views conflicted with senior intelligence leaders. In June 2014, with the ISIL threat apparent, CENTCOM established an intelligence “fusion center,” a specially equipped JIC facility staffed    to serve as a “focal point” for   intelligence. Interviewees recalled only informal communications noting the center’s establishment, and some were also uncertain about the center’s organizational structure, responsibilities, and how it was determined which JIC analysts would participate. The establishment of the Intelligence Fusion Center also removed some analysts who had the most experience with respect to ISIL and Iraq, including those whose analytic views often conflicted with those of CENTCOM’s senior intelligence leaders, from the production of daily intelligence products. This impact was especially significant given the critical analytic tasks of the Intelligence Fusion Center at this time of paramount importance in the theater. 3  —   Restrictions were implemented for analysts whose views dissented from the mainstream inside CENTCOM. Public statements by CENTCOM representatives emphasized close collaboration with other elements of the IC, but many interviewees indicated that in late 2014, senior CENTCOM Intelligence Directorate leaders instructed analysts to cease all external coordination with other IC analysts. The authority to coordinate was restricted to senior officials only, including to leaders of the Fusion Center. Other special arrangements were also put into place to notify the Director of Intelligence in the event that analysts sought to formally “dissent” from analysis produced elsewhere. The restrictions on collaboration have since been partially rescinded. 4  —   Analysis was minimized in favor of details from coalition forces while intelligence was skewed to be “optimistic. ” Furthermore, senior leaders also relied on details reported from coalition forces rather than more objective and better documented intelligence reporting. The Joint Task Force can find no justifiable reason why operational reporting was repeatedly used as a rationale to change the analytic product, particularly when the changes only appeared to be made in a more optimistic direction. By supplanting analytic tradecraft with unpublished and ad hoc operational reporting, Joint Intelligence Center (JIC) leadership circumvented important processes that are intended to protect the integrity of intelligence analysis. 5  —   Shocking survey results showed analysts believed data was “distorted, suppressed, or substantially altered” by their supervisors. The annual Analytic Objectivity and Process Survey, directed by the ODNI, was conducted from August through October 2015, and included responses from 125 analysts and managers within CENTCOM. The survey results were significantly worse than those of other IC agencies or COCOMs, and showed that a substantial number of CENTCOM respondents felt their supervisors distorted, suppressed, or substantially altered analytic products. Over 50% of analysts responded that CENTCOM procedures, practices, processes, and organizational structures hampered objective analysis, and 40% responded that they had experienced an attempt to distort or suppress intelligence in the past year. Yet despite receiving these results in December 2015, CENTCOM and IC leaders did not take corrective actions to address many of the issues identified in the survey results. 6  —   Intelligence analysts declined to be interviewed, possibly out of fear of reprisals from CENTCOM leadership, while the interviews that did take place were under the watchful eyes of DOD officials. Additionally, the Joint Task Force requested interviews with four more analysts whose positions provided them with visibility into the allegations. These analysts declined to be interviewed. Although they did not express their reasons for declining, the Joint Task Force is concerned that some of the analysts may have done so out of fear of potential reprisals for their testimony. For example, as the Joint Task Force’s interviews were commencing, the Director of the DIA publicly characterized reports of the whistleblower’s allegations as exaggerations. It must also be noted that, pursuant to longstanding arrangements between DOD and the Armed Services Committee, DOD insisted on having department officials present during Joint Task Force interviews. 7  —   CENTCOM intel agents operated in a “toxic” leadership environment. The Republican lawmakers fingered CENTCOM leaders, and noted the intelligence process was cleaner under previous officials and Lloyd Austin III, who served as commander from  . Dozens of analysts viewed the “subsequent leadership environment as toxic”: Survey results provided to the Joint Task Force demonstrated that dozens of analysts viewed the subsequent leadership environment as toxic, with 40% of analysts responding that they had experienced an attempt to distort or suppress intelligence in the past year. 8  —   General Austin’s claim to Congress that IS was in a “defensive crouch” did not reflect the data possessed at the time by CENTCOM senior leaders. Although no interviewee remembered the process of preparing the specific press releases and congressional testimony highlighted here, interviewees described a process in which congressional testimony and public affairs statements did not necessarily reflect contemporaneous intelligence assessments. In particular, the Joint Task Force was dismayed to learn that Intelligence Directorate senior leaders seemed unfamiliar with General Austin’s statements to Congress that ISIL was in a “defensive crouch” and indicated this characterization did not reflect their best assessments at the time. 9  —   Even after whistleblower complaints and the “alarming” internal survey last year, the Pentagon took no steps to correct its allegedly distorted intelligence process. The Joint Task Force is troubled that despite receiving the whistleblower complaint in May 2015 and receiving alarming survey results in December 2015, neither CENTCOM, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, nor the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) took any demonstrable steps to improve the analytic climate within CENTCOM. The survey results alone should have prompted CENTCOM and IC leaders to take corrective action without other inducements. 10  —   Mirroring the Benghazi House Committee’s complaints against the State Department, the Joint Task Force here writes it “did not receive access to all the materials it requested” and details a process of denying information and records.

8832,27568,Hillary Emails: Top Clinton Aide Plotted to ‘Help’ News Media ‘Figure Out How Things Work’,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,3/30/2017,2017,3,,"TEL AVIV  —   In a 2010 email released yesterday by Judicial Watch, Jake Sullivan,   Chief of Staff to Hillary Clinton at the State Department, discusses how to “help” news media figures “’figure out’ how things work. ”[Sullivan later served as chief foreign policy adviser to Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.  The February 9, 2010 email in question was sent to longtime Clinton confidantes Huma Abedin and Cheryl D. Mills, and to Philippe I. Reines, who served as Clinton’s Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Strategic Communications. It was an exchange started by Sullivan, who asked why New York Times columnist David Brooks “took a shot at me in his column today. ” “Any ideas what prompted it?” asked Sullivan. Brooks column that day, titled, “The House of Tranquillity” did not specifically mention Sullivan. It stated of Clinton and Iraq that, “Hillary Clinton’s influence on this and all issues is exceptionally hard to figure out. ” Brooks may have been referring to Sullivan and other top Clinton aides when he wrote: Finally, Biden was asked to come up with a   agenda. This is a surprisingly difficult job because many of these programs  —   credits for college affordability and child care  —   fairly reek of Clintonism. This is an administration that is staffed by Clintonites but does not want to appear Clintonian in any way. In response to Sullivan’s email asking what may have prompted Brooks’ alleged criticism, Reines replied, “Not sure  —   but this is a good excuse to bring him in for an OTR with you. Lona mentioned you wanted to see Tom Friedman  —   with your ok, we could schedule both (separately) over the next month or so. ” OTR is an acronym for an    conversation, something fairly common in government circles.  Reines was referring to Times’ columnist Thomas Friedman. Sullivan responded with his comment about helping media personalities “’figure out’ how things work”: Philippe and I had an offline conversation about this and I agree entirely. I think it makes sense for you to meet with influencers on a regular  —   though not intrusive  —   basis. An OTR conversation with you is the best way to help guys like Brooks “figure out” how things work. The email was part of a batch of 1, 184 pages released yesterday by Judicial Watch following a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The correspondence included 29 previously undisclosed emails.  The Sullivan email about Brooks was also previously released by WiliLeaks, but it received no news media attention. Previous   emails discussed methods of utilizing the news media for messaging. Breitbart News previously reported a memo requested by Clinton recommended that the State Department utilize “Specialty Media” to get its foreign policy message across, a newly released State Department email reveals. The 2009 memo urged Clinton to use her star power and singled out shows including Oprah, Ellen, The View, and others to be used to “amplify and deliver messages that advance policymaking. ” The section on The View stated that while the program lacks “international distribution, it makes up for it by creating a media echo chamber based on the intense discussions that take place every weekday during the Hot Topics segments. ” The reference to The View as “creating a media echo chamber” may be telling. Last May, a New York Times article quoted a senior Obama administration official who used similar phraseology in describing the alleged use of the news media to sell the Iran nuclear deal to the American public. That plot was referenced in a New York Times Magazine profile of President Obama’s deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes entitled, “The Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama’s   Guru. ” Robert Malley, senior director at the National Security Council, was quoted saying “experts” were utilized to create an “echo chamber” that disseminated administration claims about Iran to “hundreds of   reporters” in the news media.

8857,27593,Ex-State Staffer Who Advocated Spying On Trump Boasted ’Getting Winks From Inside’ Obama Admin,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,4/8/2017,2017,4,,"Evelyn Farkas, a former top Obama administration official, has denied that she had access to inside information when she made remarks as a contributor to MSNBC last month that seemed to acknowledge efforts by members of the Obama administration to collect intelligence on Donald Trump and members of his 2016 presidential campaign. [However, the news media has largely failed to note that on February 16, about two weeks prior to her statements on MSNBC, Farkas revealed in an interview that she was “getting winks and hints from inside that there was something really wrong here”  —   referring to Trump officials’ alleged ties to Russia.  She stated that she was “first made aware of all this stuff” during the summer.  On March 2, Farkas stated on MSNBC that she told former Obama administration colleagues to collect intelligence on Trump and campaign officials. “I was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill, it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration,” stated Farkas. She continued: Because I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior [Obama] people who left, so it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy   …     that the Trump folks  —   if they found out how we knew what we knew about their   …     the Trump staff dealing with Russians  —   that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we no longer have access to that intelligence. After her remarks resurfaced and were subsequently used by the White House to bolster the charge that Trump was under illicit surveillance during the campaign, Farkas gave interviews denying that she had any inside information when she made those comments to MSNBC. She told the Daily Caller last week that she had no access to any intelligence. “I had no intelligence whatsoever, I wasn’t in government anymore and didn’t have access to any,” she said. Speaking to the Washington Post, Farkas denied being a source of any leaks. The Post reported: Farkas, in an interview with The Post, said she “didn’t give anybody anything except advice,” was not a source for any stories and had nothing to leak. Noting that she left government in October 2015, she said, “I was just watching like anybody else, like a regular spectator” as initial reports of Russia contacts began to surface after the election. However, on February 16, Farkas told Ezra Klein at Vox. com that she was “getting winks and hints from inside” about alleged Russia ties.  The interview was also highlighted by the Gateway Pundit blog. Farkas was asked by Klein about her “level of alarm after the resignation of Michael Flynn,” who stepped down in February as Trump’s national security adviser. Regarding her “level of alarm,” Farkas replied: It’s lower than it’s been since the summer, when I was first made aware of all this stuff. I’m like, finally, everybody else sees it! Seriously. The reason I was so upset last summer was that I was getting winks and hints from inside that there was something really wrong here. I was agitated because I knew the Clinton campaign and the world didn’t know. But I didn’t think it would happen this fast. I didn’t think Flynn would survive a year, but I thought it would be most of the year. The fact that Flynn is gone is constructive from the perspective of US foreign policy. He was getting it wrong on combating terrorism and Russia. So I feel relieved that he will not be whispering his policy prescriptions in the president’s ear. On the bigger issue, the intelligence community, the bureaucracy, patriotic Americans, and some members of Congress are making it impossible for the White House to sweep whatever they are trying to hide under the rug. And the White House is clearly trying to hide something, or the president would have said, on day one, that he would support the investigations that began under his predecessor. This past week, Breitbart News first reported that at a conference last October, held two weeks before the presidential election, Farkas predicted that if Trump won the presidency he would “be impeached pretty quickly or somebody else would have to take over government. ” Breitbart News also first reported that at the same conference, Farkas warned that more must be done to counter the forces of nationalism and populism that have been entering the mainstream with the rise of Trump and nationalist movements across Europe. Farkas currently serves as a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which takes a hawkish approach toward Russia and has released numerous reports and briefs about Russian aggression. The Council is funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc. the U. S. State Department and NATO ACT. Another Council funder is the Ploughshares Fund, which in turn has received financing from billionaire George Soros’ Open Society Foundations. Farkas serves on the Atlantic Council alongside Dmitri Alperovitch,   of CrowdStrike, the   company utilized by the FBI to make its assessment about alleged Russian hacking into the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council. Last month, FBI Director James Comey confirmed that his agency never had direct access to the DNC’s servers to confirm the hacking. “Well, we never got direct access to the machines themselves,” he stated. “The DNC in the spring of 2016 hired a firm that ultimately shared with us their forensics from their review of the system. ” National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers also stated the NSA never asked for access to the DNC hardware: “The NSA didn’t ask for access. That’s not in our job. ”  Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

8875,27611,Media Was Silent When Obama Adopted Defense Proposals from Pro-Soviet Think Tank,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,3/6/2017,2017,3,,"TEL AVIV  —   Amid the flurry of reports about the Trump administration and Russia  —   largely innuendo that has yielded no documented connections between the two sides  —   it may be instrumental to review the largely unknown history of how President Obama’s administration adopted defense budget recommendations   by the Institute for Policy Studies, a radical organization known for its close associations with the Soviets during the Cold War. [In fact, throughout the Cold War, the Institute for Policy Studies, or IPS, was repeatedly accused of holding   positions that undermined U. S. national security and serving as a de facto Soviet propaganda institution.  Yet that same group   and contributed to an annual report titled “Unified Security Budget for the United States,” an extensive yearly list of U. S. military defense spending recommendations compiled by progressive think tanks. The report seeks to   the Defense Department to “strengthen our capacity to prevent and resolve conflict by   means,” according to one IPS description of the report. A 2011 report on the IPS’s taskforce for the “Unified Security Budget” reveals how previous Unified reports influenced Obama administration defense proposals: The Unified Security Budget project has contributed to this debate by outlining a set of cuts in unneeded military programs that formed the core of a proposal by the Sustainable Defense Task Force for $1 trillion in cuts over 10 years. A majority, though not a supermajority, of the members of the President’s Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform adopted the annualized figure of $100 billion, and many of the recommendations from this proposal. The IPS’s influence over Obama administration military proposals remains largely unreported except for previous investigations by this reporter. The annual Unified Security Budget was   several times by the Center for American Progress, which was founded by John Podesta, who served as counselor to President Obama and later chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. A sampling of the IPS’s defense spending recommending can be seen in its 2012 “Unified Security Budget” report. That extensive report was previously summarized by this reporter: The 2012 budget, reviewed in full by (this reporter) called on Obama to use the U. S. Armed Forces in part to combat “global warming,” fight global poverty, remedy “injustice,” bolster the United Nations and increase “peacekeeping” forces worldwide. The budget called for massive,   slashes to the military budget. The savings are to be used to invest in “sustainable energy” and in fighting worldwide climate change. The report makes clear the stated objective of transforming the U. S. Armed Forces to stress conflict resolution and diplomacy. The report takes issue with the use of forces on the ground in various countries to secure or influence the   strategic position of other nations. It recommends scaling back all U. S. ground forces by 20 percent and reducing the Navy’s surface fleet by 20 percent, including two carriers and carrier combat air wings. It also calls for reducing the Air Force by two combat air wings while cutting standing peacetime overseas deployments in Europe and East Asia by up to 50, 000 troops at a time. The budget’s authors strongly argue for the reduction of the U. S. nuclear arsenal to no more than 292 deployed nuclear weapons and the complete elimination of the Trident II nuclear missile. It’s a process Obama already initiated in April 2010 when he signed a deal with Russia reducing stocks of   plutonium. The report further recommended the U. S. cease all missile defense development, among other cut backs. Here is more of my previous summary: The report goes through a list of current missile defense programs, including   Midcourse Defense, Airborne Laser, Kinetic Energy Interceptors and a number of others, pushing for all programs to be cut. “It is unwise to fund more advanced systems for missile defense while current ones have yet to be proven effective against their targeted threats,” complains the report. The military’s vital Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation program is to be cut by $10 billion across the board. Next on the chopping block is the complete cancellation of the second   Virginia Class submarine. While the Unified Security Budget describes the new model as “unnecessary to address any of the threats facing the United States today” and “a weapon looking for an enemy,” the   is designed for covert collection of intelligence, transportation of special operations teams and launching of tactical Tomahawk missiles  —   flexible capabilities tailored to rapid responses required by the  ’s conflicts with irregular combatants. Similarly targeted for cancellation are the   Osprey helicopter and the Navy and Marine Corps versions of the   Joint Strike Fighter. A closer look at IPS, which influenced Obama administration policy, is warranted. The organization was founded in 1963 by former government workers Marcus Raskin and Richard Barnet, both of whom were known for their ties to   groups and activism on behalf of communist regimes. Discover the Networks relates that after the group was founded, “IPS headquarters quickly became a resource center for national reporters and a place for KGB agents from the nearby Soviet embassy to convene and strategize. ” Indeed, Ladislav Bittman, a former KGB agent, claimed in his book, The KGB and Soviet Disinformation: An Insider’s View that the IPS worked as a de facto Soviet disinformation operation. Harvey Klehr, professor of politics and history at Emory University, documented the close links between the IPS and Soviet ideology in his 1988 book, Far Left of Center: The American Radical Left Today. During the Cold War, IPS fellows “consistently maintained that the Soviet threat is largely   and a product of the   complex in the United States,” he wrote. Just like their 2009 defense budget recommendations, the IPS during the Cold War pressed for the U. S. to “dangerously” downsize its military, Klehr related. He wrote: This view encouraged the IPS to demand dangerously steep cuts in American defense efforts and to claim that they would represent no danger to American security. At the request of   congressmen, IPS made a study of the federal budget in 1977. In addition to recommendations for a socialist housing program and health system, and altering capitalist control over the educational system, the IPS suggested a fifty percent cut in defense spending, an end to the American role in the Middle East, and withdrawal from NATO. Klehr further documented numerous IPS links to alleged Soviet front groups. IPS signed an agreement in 1982 with the Soviet’s Institute of the USA and Canada, headed by Georgiy Arbatov, for exchanges on peace and disarmament. Since then IPS has sponsored an annual meeting of American experts and Soviet officials. Although portrayed by the Soviets as an “independent”   “think tank,” the Institute of the USA and Canada has been widely identified as an instrument of Soviet foreign policy influence. Located in Moscow, the IUSAC is nominally under the direction of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In practice, however, it operates under the direction of the International Department of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee. According to the testimony of John McMahon, then deputy director of Central Intelligence (during the House Selected Committee on Intelligence Hearings on Soviet Active Measures in 1982) the International Department “directs Western dialogue activities of Soviet organizations such as the   Institute” with a view toward influencing Western perceptions of peace and disarmament. In his book, Shadow World: Resurgent Russia, The Global New Left, and Radical Islam, author Robert Chandler further documents FBI memos describing the IPS as a   nerve center. The FBI produced thousands of documents on IPS’s activities. Some are available to the public through the Freedom of Information Act. The FBI withheld hundreds of documents. The documents collected by the FBI described IPS as a   “Think Factory,” which “helped train extremists who incite violence in the United States and whose educational research serves as a cover for intrigue and political agitation” (FBI file  ) or “the Rand Corporation of the Left,” and “IPS apparently exercises considerable influence in the New Left Movement and may have as its goal the destruction of the United States Government. ” In this context, the mainstream media described the IPS in the 1970s and 1980s as follows: Wall Street Journal  —   “A funnel for disinformation,” Forbes  —   “A radical Washington propaganda mill,” National Review  —   “The perfect intellectual front for Soviet activities which would be resisted if they were to originate openly from the KGB. ” This reporter previously documented the Cold     activities of the IPS. The IPS has been implicated in   activity. The Center for Security Studies was a 1974 IPS   and strove to compromise the effectiveness of U. S. intelligence agencies, according to Discover the Networks. The mastheads of two   and   publications, Counterspy and the Covert Action Information Bulletin, were heavy with IPS members. Further, the group’s former director, Robert Borosage, penned a book shortly out of college attacking the CIA and ran the   CIA watchdog, Center for National Security Studies. The group has been particularly concerned with researching U. S. defense industries and arms sales policies.  Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

8947,27683,EXCLUSIVE: Ex-Gitmo Warden ‘Disgusted’ Obama Released More Detainees,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,1/9/2017,2017,1,,"Col. Michael Bumgarner, the former commander of the guard force at the U. S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, stated in an interview on Sunday that he is “disgusted” by President Obama’s continued effort to empty out Gitmo. [Bumgarner charged Obama with attempting to use Gitmo to ensure his legacy at the expense of national security. He served from April 2005  —   June 2006 as commander of the Joint Detention Group, the guard force component of the Joint Task Force at the U. S. prison in Guantanamo.  The Pentagon announced last Thursday that four detainees had been released to Saudi Arabia, where they will purportedly participate in a rehabilitation program.  From the 535 detainees in Gitmo during Bumgarner’s work there, the population is now down to 55, and 19 of those have reportedly been cleared for release. There is speculation Obama may release more detainees in his final days in office. “It has nothing to do with national security reasons,” stated Bumgarner. He was speaking on this reporter’s Sunday night talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and Philadelphia’s NewsTalk 990 AM. Listen to the interview here: Continued Bumgarner: His whole motivation has nothing to do with national security. In my mind, it is clearly a legacy issue for Obama who signed on, you know, day one of his presidency, ‘I am going to close Guantanamo.’ I knew then   …     that would never happen. It is just impossible. He had no clue what he had just signed. And he has found out how hard that is. So, the argument always is that they (the terrorists) make this a propaganda matter to recruit more people. You and I both follow this pretty closely. I don’t ever see it out there that Guantanamo is your call to battle, you know. I never see that. You and I both know what drives this fight. It has nothing to do with national security. Again, it’s a legacy issue for Obama. And I’m ashamed that it is occurring. Embarrassed. Disgusted. I don’t know how it to make it stronger. Asked whether he had any advice regarding Gitmo for   Donald Trump, Bumgarner replied: One, it certainly should not be closed. And two, increase its population. And by that it’s just not that we want to stack up Guantanamo Bay. But the whole purpose is  —   this may strike people as funny  —   but rather than kill the terrorists on the battlefield when we engage with the ISIS fighters, bring them in for the intelligence value that they can provide.   …     Use the intelligence value. The great capacity and capability of Guantanamo. Let’s fill it up with people and let the intelligence world go to work and develop the human intelligence that we so badly need. Fox News last week cited statistics from U. S. officials saying 30 percent of previously released Gitmo detainees are suspected of returning to terrorist activity. Bumgarner commented, “And you know Aaron when we talk about these numbers   …     let’s just think about that.   …     Think about the destruction that just one man carried out in Berlin. That fellow in France. So, if you can stop one, you saved numerous lives. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

9146,27882,Who ’Paid for’ Tax Day Protests? Breitbart Revealed Organizers’ Soros Ties Months Ago,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,4/17/2017,2017,4,,"President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to call for an investigation into “who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday”  —   referring to the   Tax Day March held Saturday in Washington and at least 60 other locations. [Trump may have missed a Breitbart News exclusive investigative article penned by this reporter on February 16 titled, “Soros Groups Behind Massive   Tax Day Protest Plot. ”  While there is no immediate information on who directly bankrolled this specific protest movement, Breitbart News found that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by George Soros or have close links to Soros financing. Someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday. The election is over!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2017,  Trump’s tweet itself received widespread news media coverage. However, scores of major news media articles reviewed by this reporter failed to document the Soros ties to the tax march. “Trump calls for investigation into Tax Day protesters, tweets ‘election is over! ’” reads a CNBC. com article. After noting an initial Trump tweet on the difficulty of a Republican winning the Electoral College, NBC News reported: The president then followed up by repeating an unsubstantiated claim he’s made before that some of the protesters against him were “paid,” an allegation that became popular in some   circles in the build up to the 2016 presidential election, before noting that the election was “over. ” “Trump’s Tweets Give Tax Day Marchers at Least Part of What They Wanted,” noted the headline in a Vanity Fair report. The article’s   reads: “He may never release his tax returns, but thousands of marchers around the country got their message heard. ” The website for the Tax Day march claims that its mission is to get Trump to release his tax returns and more. The site reads: President Trump needs to be straight with the American people. To whom does he owe favors? Who are his policies really intended to benefit? Who will he put first? Working families are struggling to make ends meet, but we pay our fair share in taxes  —   does Donald Trump pay any at all? A query about protest financing sent to the email address for press inquiries listed on the Tax Day March website was not answered as of this writing. Organizers of the March claim to be “ordinary Americans, community organizers, advocates, and people from all walks of life and all backgrounds joining together to raise our voices and send a bold message to this administration. ” In February, Breitbart News documented a section of the Tax Day March website titled, “Who is organizing it?” The website for the Tax March listed the following eight groups, six of which are either funded by Soros or tied to Soros financing. The Tax March is grateful to have the support of the following organizations: American Federation of Teachers, Americans for Tax Fairness, Center for Popular Democracy, Indivisible Project, MoveOn. Org, Our Revolution, and The Working Families Party. Americans for Tax Fairness is the recipient of a grant from Soros’s Open Society Foundations’ U. S. Programs. MoveOn. Org is financed by Soros. The American Federation of Teachers’ Educational Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the American Federation of Teachers, was financed by the Strategic Opportunities Fund of Soros’s Open Society Foundations, leaked Open Society documents show. The Center for Popular Democracy is led by   activists. In 2013, Marbre Stahly, a policy advocate at the Center, became a Soros Justice Fellow, which comes with a stipend of $ $110, 250 to fund   activism projects that last between   months. The Center was listed as Stahly’s “host” for the grant. According to her bio, the Center’s research analyst, Maggie Corser, “spent four years at the Open Society Foundations where she conducted research on the future of work, conservative political infrastructure, and a range of economic justice issues. ” Shawn Sebastian, the Center’s field director for its Fed Up Campaign, was a fellow at the so called   Unit of the Open Society Foundations’ Justice Initiative. Another Tax March organizer is the   Indivisible Project. In February, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by Soros. Leaders of January’s Women’s March coalition reportedly helped to organize the Tax March, which USA Today described as a “sequel” to the massive march. Buzzfeed took note of the comparison to the Women’s March in a piece titled, “Progressives Want Tax Day To Be The Next Women’s March Protest. ” Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 “partners” of the Women’s March. This journalist first reported on the march leaders’ close associations with Soros. Since Breitbart’s probe in February, numerous other   groups joined the march and are listed as “partners” on the group’s website. The   “partners” include Demos and Public Citizen, among others.  Meanwhile, at the protest itself, Rep. Maxine Waters ( .) called for Trump to be impeached.  “I don’t respect this president. I don’t trust this president. He’s not working in the best interests of the American people,” complained Waters. “I will fight every day until he is impeached,” she stated.

9245,27981,Soros-Funded Media Matters Secretly Plotting to ‘Stop’ Breitbart News - Breitbart,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,1/27/2017,2017,1,,"Media Matters for America, the George   progressive activist organization, has been secretly planning a major campaign to “stop” Breitbart News. [The scheme was documented in a Media Matters briefing book obtained by the Washington Free Beacon at a retreat for current and prospective donors held in Florida over the weekend.  The   pamphlet listed a core budget goal for 2017 of $13. 4 million, which the booklet says would pay for a staff of 81, ostensibly to wage war on independent news media outlets like Breitbart.  The briefing book focused heavily on Breitbart News, which was repeatedly singled out as a target. In one section of the pamphlet, in which Media Matters bills itself as “the top watchdog against fake news and propaganda,” the progressive media activist group falsely claims that Breitbart News “provides a nexus point for the     (the newest branding for American white nationalism,   and misogyny) to exploit vulnerabilities throughout the media landscape. ” “With a powerful ally in the White House (former chief executive Steve Bannon will be Trump’s chief strategist) Breitbart plans to export its brand of   racism on a global scale. ” Media Matters, founded by Hillary Clinton ally David Brock, did not provide a single example to back up its numerous smears against Breitbart News. “In a   media environment, the right is aggressively exploiting vulnerabilities and finding new ways to poison the information ecosystem with lies,” Media Matters claimed of Breitbart News and “Trump TV,” the conservative media outlet run by the Right Side Broadcasting Network. “Media Matters is ready to stop them. ” Another section of the pamphlet, titled, “Media Advocacy  —   Punish enabling and complacency,” singles out Breitbart News after boasting that “Media Matters will be vigilant in holding news media accountable for even the slightest bit of normalization of Trump. ” The pamphlet claims that Media Matters “first sounded the alarm about Breitbart’s international expansion and began working with journalists in the United States and abroad to educate them on Breitbart’s model as well as the larger universe of   activity for which Breitbart is the nexus. ” Breitbart’s international expansion included the launch last year of Breitbart Jerusalem, headed by this reporter, which daily shines the light of accurate reportage on one of the most unfairly reported arenas in the international market and is known to be one of the most   news media outlets in America. To combat Breitbart News and other outlets, Media Matters mapped out a strategy that includes engagement with social media giants like Facebook, as the Free Beacon first reported. The pamphlet states: After Facebook responded to our campaign by acknowledging the problem of fake news and agreeing to do something about it, we began a dialogue. It became clear from these conversations that Facebook needed our help in fully understanding the problem and identifying concrete solutions. Further, it also became clear that we had information and insight that they didn’t have that was helpful in educating them on the full scope of the problem. Later, the pamphlet reveals (emphasis added): Our campaign was covered by prominent national political, business, and tech media outlets, and we’ve been engaging with Facebook leadership behind the scenes to share our expertise and offer input on developing meaningful solutions. The Free Beacon attempted to get a comment from Facebook: A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on its interactions with Media Matters, but a source familiar with the company’s thinking stressed that it routinely speaks with groups from across the political spectrum. Separately, Brock recently announced that he intends to turn his   news website, Shareblue, into a “Breitbart of the left. ” A different pamphlet, also obtained by the Free Beacon and distributed at last weekend’s donors retreat, presents a grand strategy for Shareblue, declaring, “We must become the antidote to Breitbart. ”  The pamphlet reveals a 2017 budget of $2 million, which “covers 18 total staff, including six   content producers. ” The booklet says of Shareblue’s plans: To compete with Breitbart and the   media infrastructure that will do Trump’s bidding, Shareblue must scale up from a Facebook native news site to a diversified media company, operating across platforms with varied and   content offerings and products. Shareblue plans to continuously monitor the following outcomes to ensure Brock’s outlet is “on track,” the pamphlet states (emphasis was in original pamphlet): Shareblue becomes the   news outlet for grassroots Trump opponents. Facebook engagement with our content doubles each year. Shareblue. com traffic also doubles each year. Twitter following increases 25% per year. Shareblue becomes the de facto news outlet for opposition leaders. Democratic offices, campaigns, and progressive organizations will routinely pitch us stories, funnel us information, and share our content, and we’ll measure ally engagement. Shareblue content will be used in paid political ads on television and digital mediums. Trump allies are forced to step down or change course due to news we push. Intel and oppo given to us exclusively will become higher quality, with higher potential for impact, as our credibility and footprint grows. Under pressure from Shareblue, Democrats take more aggressive positions against Trump. Democrats will echo the aggressive, emotive messaging Shareblue models and take action accordingly. Media Matters, meanwhile, is not publicly listed as a partner of Facebook in its quest to fight   fake news. Facebook last month explained it will work with “    organizations” that are signatories to the code of principles crafted by the International   Network (IFCN) which is a project of the Poynter Institute. Facebook says that if the “fact checking organizations” determine that a certain story is fake, it will get flagged as disputed and, according to the Facebook announcement, “there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed. ” A cursory search of the Poynter Institute website finds that Poynter’s IFCN is openly funded by Soros’ Open Society Foundations as well as the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, Google, and the National Endowment for Democracy. Soros has also financed Media Matters, including by providing a $1 million donation in 2010 “to hold Fox News accountable for the false and misleading information they so often broadcast. ” Media Matters is known for its controversial tactics against outlets like Fox News, Breitbart and talk radio. Earlier this week, Media Matters Senior Fellow Matthew Gertz asked for help in maintaining a “comprehensive database of who gets to ask questions at” Trump press briefings. Brock once described Media Matters as aiming to wage an   campaign of “guerrilla warfare and sabotage” against Fox News. An extensive Daily Caller investigation in 2012 reported that internal Media Matters memos revealed a comprehensive enemies list. The Daily Caller reported: An internal Media Matters For America memo obtained by The Daily Caller reveals that the   media watchdog group employs an “opposition research team” to target its political enemies. Included in the list of targets are   websites, conservative think tanks, prominent financiers and donors, and more than a dozen specific Fox News Channel and News Corporation employees. “We will conduct extensive public records searches and compile opposition books on individuals,” declares the memo, likely written in late 2009. Investigations, it says, “will focus on the backgrounds, connections, operations and political and financial activities of the individuals. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

9290,28026,Report: Obama Intel Officials Used ‘Russia Blackmail’ Claims to Warn Israel About Trusting Trump  ,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,1/12/2017,2017,1,,"TEL AVIV  —   U. S. intelligence officials warned their Israeli counterparts not to trust   Donald Trump with intelligence secrets, citing alleged fears that Russia held blackmail information over Trump, according to a report today in Israel’s respected Yediot Ahronot daily newspaper. [The alleged blackmail information that U. S. officials reportedly warned Israel about seems to be in part referencing details contained in a debunked document of mysterious origin purporting to be an intelligence report alleging that Russia collected compromising videos and information on Trump.  In the report, investigative journalist Ronen Bergman writes of a meeting that took place “recently between Israeli and American intelligence officials (the date of the meeting is not mentioned to protect the sources of the report). ” Continued Bergman: During the meeting, according to the Israelis who participated in it, their American colleagues voiced despair over Trump’s election, as he often lashes out at the American intelligence community. The American officials also told the Israelis that the National Security Agency (NSA) had “highly credible information” that Russia’s intelligence agencies, the FSB and GRU, were responsible for hacking the Democratic Party (DNC) servers during the elections and leaking sensitive information to WikiLeaks, which hurt Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The American officials further added that they believed Russian President Vladimir Putin had “leverages of pressure” over Trump  —   but did not elaborate. They were apparently referring to what was published Wednesday about embarrassing information collected by the Russian intelligence in a bid to blackmail the  . The Americans implied that their Israeli colleagues should “be careful” as of January 20, Trump’s inauguration date, when transferring intelligence information to the White House and to the National Security Council (NSC) which is subject to the president. According to the Israelis who were present in the meeting, the Americans recommended that until it is made clear that Trump is not inappropriately connected to Russia and is not being extorted  —   Israel should avoid revealing sensitive sources to administration officials for fear the information would reach the Iranians. BuzzFeed on Tuesday published the   document claiming Russia had collected blackmail information on Trump, including videos of the   in compromising positions. “The allegations are unverified, and the report contains errors,” a BuzzFeed   cautioned. Contacted by Breitbart Jerusalem, Bergman said that according to his sources, the meeting between U. S. and Israeli officials took place before the publication of the dossier on Tuesday and that the dossier wasn’t specifically mentioned to the Israelis, only the charge that Russian President Vladimir Putin has some sort of unspecified “leverage” over Trump. Bergman said that after the dossier was published, he contacted his sources again and they told him that they themselves were speculating that the “leverage” claim could have in part referred to the dossier.  Bergman is the author of a forthcoming book on the history of the Mossad set to be published later this year by Random House.

CNN fanned the flames by reporting that “classified documents” presented to President Obama and Trump included “allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information” on Trump, the news network claimed, citing “multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings. ” The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday reported the author of the dossier was Christopher Steele, who serves as a director at the   Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd. which has refused to comment on the reports of the document’s origin. In October, Mother Jones reported on the contents of the dossier, writing the information was produced by a former Western intelligence officer who was assigned to the task for the purpose of an “opposition research project originally financed by a Republican client critical of the celebrity mogul. ” Director of National Intelligence James Clapper released a statement yesterday that he had called Trump that day to tell him that the intelligence community “has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

9511,28247,Trump Arrives in Israel for Presidential Trip to Holy Land,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,5/22/2017,2017,5,,"President Donald Trump on Monday touched down in Israel for a   visit to the Jewish state, the second stop of his first foreign as U. S. president. [Trump was greeted at a red carpet ceremony at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv by a large delegation that included Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sarah as well as Netanyahu’s cabinet, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, government ministers and Knesset Members.  Trump’s tour here marks the first time a U. S. president visited Israel during a first presidential trip abroad. “Never before has the first foreign trip of the president of the United States included a visit to Israel,” Netanyahu said in his remarks at the airport ceremony. “Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for this powerful expression of your friendship to Israel. Upon landing, Trump praised “unbreakable bond” between the U. S. and Israel. “On my first trip overseas as president, I have come to this sacred and ancient land to reaffirm the unbreakable bond between the United States and the State of Israel,” Trump said. “We love Israel, we respect Israel, and I bring the warmest greetings from your friend and ally, all of the people of the United States of America,” Trump stated. He continued: During my travels in recent days, I have found new reasons for hope. I have just concluded a visit to Saudi Arabia, where yesterday I met with King Salman and leaders from across the Muslim and Arab world. In that visit we reached a historic agreement to pursue greater and greater [cooperation] against terrorism. We have before us a rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace to this region and to its people, defeating terrorism and creating a future of harmony prosperity and peace. But we can only get there working together. There is no other way. Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, I look forward to working with both of you during my stay. Natanyahu pointed out that in Saudi Arabia yesterday, Trump “delivered a forceful speech on terrorism and extremism, called on forces of civilization to confront the forces of barbarism. ” “For 69 years, Israel has been doing just that,” Netanyahu said. “We’ve manned the   of civilization. ” “In doing so we’ve protected all faiths, Muslims, Christians, everyone,” Netanyahu said. “Israel’s hand is extended in peace to all our neighbors, including the Palestinians,” Netanyahu continued. “The peace we seek is a genuine one, in which the Jewish state is recognized, security remains in Israel’s hands, and the conflict ends once and for all. ” “Mr. President, you just flew from Riyadh to Tel Aviv,” Netanyahu added. “I hope that one day an Israeli prime minister can fly from Tel Aviv to Riyadh. ” After the arrival ceremony at Ben Gurion Airport, Trump will travel by helicopter to Jerusalem and meet with Rivlin at the Israeli president’s residence.   From there he will continue to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, one of the holiest sites in Christianity, and stop for a visit to the Western Wall before heading to a private social dinner with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On Tuesday, Trump’s schedule includes a meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem and a wreath laying ceremony at Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.  Trump will then give a speech at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem before departing the country. Trump will be in Jerusalem on Jerusalem Day, a national holiday here that marks Israel’s reunification of Jerusalem after the 1967 Six Day War and the establishment of Israeli sovereignty over the eastern sections of the city, which include the Old City, Western Wall and Temple Mount. Many will be watching to see if Trump uses the visit to announce a move of the U. S. embassy from the beach in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, although reports put that as unlikely. U. S. law requires the relocation of the embassy to Jerusalem. However, President Obama signed successive waivers delaying the move. The current waiver expires on June 1. Numerous reports in recent days cited White House officials saying that Trump is not expected to use the visit to announce an embassy move. Still, that prognosis is subject to change. “The president has not made a decision yet and is still reviewing that,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said last week. Focus will also be on whether Trump uses the trip to announce that the U. S. will broker new   talks aimed at creating a Palestinian state. There have been reports Trump is seeking to   talks for a period of six to twelve months without preconditions. The Palestinian Authority has a history of bolting talks and rejecting each previous Israeli offer of a state. These offers were made at Camp David in 2000, Taba in 2001, the Annapolis Conference in 2007 and again in 2008. The past few years, the PA also failed to respond to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s unprecedented attempts to   negotiations aimed at creating a Palestinian state, including freezing Jewish construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem, and releasing Palestinian prisoners.

9546,28282,FBI’s Comey Debunks Huma Abedin’s Excuse for Clinton Emails Appearing on Anthony Weiner’s Laptop,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,5/8/2017,2017,5,,"Missing from much of the news media coverage of FBI Director James Comey’s testimony last week that   top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin regularly forwarded classified emails to her husband, Anthony Weiner, is that the revelation directly contradicts Abedin’s own claims from last November about how the emails famously made it to Weiner’s laptop computer. [During last Wednesday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on FBI oversight, Comey stated Abedin appears to have engaged in a “regular practice of forwarding  ” to Weiner’s computer, possibly for him to print out.  The testimony, which came during an exchange with Sen. John Kennedy ( ) about classified emails found on Weiner’s computer, went thusly: KENNEDY: OK. Was there classified information on  —   on former Congressman Weiner’s computer? COMEY: Yes. KENNEDY: Who sent it to him? COMEY: His then spouse, Huma Abedin, appears to have had a regular practice of forwarding   to him, for him I think to print out for her so she could then deliver them to the Secretary of State. Those details seem to contradict claims made by Abedin last November through her lawyer, Karen Dunn, immediately following reports that the FBI discovered possible Clinton emails on her estranged husband’s computer. Dunn claimed that Abedin did not know how the emails could have reached Weiner’s device and only learned about the possibility of emails being on Weiner’s laptop via media reports. “She only learned for the first time on Friday, from press reports, of the possibility that a laptop belonging to Mr. Weiner could contain emails of hers. While the FBI has not contacted us about this, Ms. Abedin will continue to be, as she always has been, forthcoming and cooperative,” Dunn said in the statement. Politico further quoted a “source familiar with Abedin’s account” as stating that, according to Politico’s portrayal, that Abedin “has told colleagues she was taken aback when she learned that the FBI found her emails on a laptop belonging to her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, and doesn’t know how the messages got there. ” That’s a far cry from Comey’s testimony that Abedin appears to have regularly forwarded Clinton emails to Weiner. Weiner was seemingly trusted in Clinton’s inner circle. As Breitbart News reported last November, one Clinton email released at the time had Clinton asking Abedin whether a trusted staff member working for Weiner could deliver a secure cell phone to Clinton. Meanwhile, Comey’s revelation has some calling for a special prosecutor to probe Abedin. Last week, Sen. Richard Blumenthal ( ) was asked on MSNBC’s Morning Joe whether he believes Abedin’s actions were potentially criminal. “If there was classified information and it was improperly passed to a person unauthorized to receive it. Yes, it’s a crime,” he said. “Without knowing what the intentions were and so forth, there is potentially a prosecutable crime. ” “Should it have been prosecuted?” host Joe Scarborough asked. “It still may be potentially. It’s not outside the statute of limitations. Who will decide it? That’s why we need a special prosecutor to review all of this investigative material,” Blumenthal replied.

9623,28359,Truck Terror Attack in Jerusalem Follows Mounting International Pressure on Israel,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,1/8/2017,2017,1,,"TEL AVIV  —   The timing of today’s deadly   terrorist attack in Jerusalem may be instructive. [The attack, carried out in the eastern Jerusalem neighborhood of Armon Hanatziv, also known as Eastern Talpiot, comes less than three weeks after the United Nations Security Council declared eastern Jerusalem to be “occupied Palestinian territory. ”  It follows   Secretary of State John Kerry’s Mideast policy speech in which he largely blamed Israel for the absence of negotiations (while the Palestinians have refused multiple statehood offers as well as attempts by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to jumpstart talks) and he repeatedly slammed Israeli settlement construction, including in eastern Jerusalem.  Notably, the State Department’s condemnation of today’s attack referred to the location of the terrorist onslaught as “Jerusalem” instead of “East Jerusalem. ” Today’s eastern Jerusalem truck terror comes one week before the Palestinians are scheduled to attend a farcical Paris “peace” conference at which the international community, minus Israel, is slated to get together to set the future parameters of a Palestinian state. Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely was right to link today’s carnage to the Paris summit. “The world has received a clear answer from the Palestinians to the peace conference coming up in Paris: More terror,” Hotovely said. “I again call on the international community to demand an end to terror and the industry of education toward it. ” The Palestinians have a long and sordid history of responding to peace talks or international pressure on Israel with a terror campaign targeting Israelis. Arch Terrorist Yasser Arafat personified that tactic when he responded to generous Israeli statehood offers in September 2000 by launching the deadly Second Intifada instead of accepting a Palestinian state or even making a counter offer. Within less than   hours of last month’s   UN resolution, I noticed an immediate uptick in Palestinian terrorist attacks targeting Jews in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem, the very areas where Israeli construction was singled out in the UN document. I wrote at the time it was too early to tell whether the violence represented a spike in Palestinian terrorism following the UN vote or whether the incidents were part of the      trend known as the   Palestinian wave of terror that seems to escalate and then slow down. With today’s truck terror, we may be more clearly seeing the Palestinian response to the mounting international pressure on Israel.

9626,28362,"Five Outrages Inside UNESCO Resolution Denying Israeli Ties to Jerusalem, Judaism’s Holiest Sites",Breitbart,Aaron Klein,5/2/2017,2017,5,,"JERUSALEM  —   While Israelis here are celebrating the country’s Independence Day today, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) passed a resolution disavowing Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem and ignoring Jewish ties to the religion’s holiest sites. [In no particular order, here are five outrages within the text of the nonbinding UNESCO resolution, which was submitted by Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, and Sudan and passed in a   UNESCO vote:  1  —   The resolution designates Judaism’s second holiest site, the Tomb of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs, and Judaism’s third holiest site, Rachel’s Tomb, as “an integral part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. ” 2  —   The resolution claims it is “safeguarding” the “cultural heritage of Palestine,” despite the fact that no such country exists. Palestine previously referred to territories that encompass present day Israel and Jordan. It was utilized in the 1917 Balfour Declaration to call for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people. ”  In the case of the resolution, UNESCO clearly intended “Palestine” to connote a Palestinian state within Israel even though there is no such state. 3  —   The text refers to eastern sections of Jerusalem as an entity called “East Jerusalem” in a clear attempt to lobby for the division of Jerusalem. The full clause states: Affirming that nothing in the current decision, which aims, inter alia, at the safeguarding of the cultural heritage of Palestine and the distinctive character of East Jerusalem, shall in any way affect the relevant Security Council and United Nations resolutions and decisions on the legal status of Palestine and Jerusalem, including United Nations Security Council resolution 2334 (2016). In reality, Jerusalem is one city there is no city called East Jerusalem. The term is largely utilized to claim that Israel is occupying “East Jerusalem,” and that the city section should become part of a future Palestinian state.   Jews maintained a historic presence in Jerusalem, including in the eastern sections, until they were forced to leave the Old City en masse in 1948. Jordan illegally occupied and annexed the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem from 1948 until Israel captured the lands in a defensive war in 1967. The 1967 Six Day War was launched after Arab countries used the territories to stage attacks against the Jewish state.  In 1988, Jordan officially renounced its claims to the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem and unilaterally recognized terrorist Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organization as “the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. ” 4  —   The resolution refers to Israel as an “occupying power” in its own capital, Jerusalem. It claims all fundamental Israeli territorial actions in Jerusalem are “null and void. ” The text states:  Reminding that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, and in particular the “basic law” on Jerusalem, are null and void and must be rescinded forthwith. In actuality, the Palestinians never had a state in either the West Bank or eastern Jerusalem and they are not legally recognized as the authorities in those areas for Israel to be occupying the land from.  The UNESCO resolution further ignores that the Temple Mount and Western Wall  —   the holiest sites in Judaism  —   are located in eastern Jerusalem, which is steeped in Jewish history. 5  —   The resolution forbids Israel to carry out “excavations, tunneling, works and projects in East Jerusalem, particularly in and around the Old City of Jerusalem. ” The sponsoring countries seem to fear that excavations in these areas routinely uncover archaeological evidence further tying Jews to Jerusalem. For example, discoveries at the City of David, an archeological site just outside the Temple Mount, have unearthed the core of ancient Jerusalem, including Hezekiah’s Tunnel, evidence of the Gihon Spring, Jewish Temple artifacts, Temple purifying pools and more.

9661,28397,"John Kerry, 72 Countries Set to Gang Up On Israel At Paris ‘Peace’ Summit on Sunday",Breitbart,Aaron Klein,1/13/2017,2017,1,,"TEL AVIV  —   In a shameful display of rogue diplomacy, 72 countries  —   minus Israel  —   are set to attend a Middle East “peace” conference in Paris on Sunday widely expected to set the parameters for a future Palestinian state. [Fresh from his   speech two weeks ago largely singling out Israel for condemnation,   Secretary of State John Kerry will represent the U. S.  at the Mideast confab. There, Kerry is slated to represent the Obama administration in crafting a “consensus” document on an   deal.  This after a U. S. abstention last month allowed the passage of a United Nations Security Council Resolution calling the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem “occupied Palestinian territories,” and demanding a halt to Israeli construction in those areas. Some of the holiest sites in Judaism are located in eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank, including the Western Wall and Temple Mount in Jerusalem’s Old City the Cave of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs in Hebron, which was home to the oldest continuous Jewish community in the world until the Jews of Hebron were massacred and expelled the Tomb of Rachel in Bethlehem and Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus  —   biblical Shechem. The Associated Press on Friday reported on what it said was a draft statement that may be presented at the conference calling on Israel and the Palestinian Authority “to officially restate their commitment to the   solution. ” Continued the AP on the draft statement: It also will affirm that the international community “will not recognize” changes to Israel’s   lines without agreement by both sides. The draft says that participants will affirm “that a negotiated solution with two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security, is the only way to achieve enduring peace. ” Earlier this week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rightly described the Paris summit as a “rigged” effort aimed at inflicting damage on Israel. The Paris onslaught may not be the end of it.  Two weeks ago, Breitbart Jerusalem cited a senior PA official saying the PA has been in contact with the Obama administration and European countries about the possibility of taking more UN action based on the outcome of the Paris conference. Citing the official, Breitbart Jerusalem reported: The official said the UN action could come in the form of declarations by UN bodies, including the General Assembly UN sessions on the   conflict or even another United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution.  He said any further UNSC resolution would depend on the support of the U. S. and European countries after the upcoming Paris Mideast summit slated for January 15. He said the UN action would seek to set the parameters of a future Palestinian state with a clear timeline for negotiations.  If the action comes in the form of a resolution at a UN body, it could call for an infrastructure to establish mechanisms to enforce last month’s UNSC resolution. The PA official said the proposals set forth at the Paris Mideast conference will likely serve as the basis for upcoming UN action. An Israeli official told Breitbart Jerusalem that the Israeli government is aware of the possibility of more UN action in the coming weeks, although the official did not have information about a new UNSC resolution. Instead, a spokesperson for the State Department pointed to Tuesday’s press briefing with Deputy Spokesperson Mark C. Toner at which Toner was asked about future action on the   conflict and replied that the Obama administration will continue to “work until January 20th. ” The process of using international mechanisms to pressure Israel can only be viewed through the lens of a diplomatic assault on the Jewish state. If the Palestinians wanted a state, they would not have to resort to introducing   resolutions at the UN. Israel has offered the Palestinians a state in much of the West Bank and Gaza Strip with a shared capital in Jerusalem numerous times. These offers were made at Camp David in 2000, Taba in 2001, the Annapolis Conference in 2007, and more offers were made in 2008. In each of these cases, the PA refused generous Israeli offers of statehood and bolted negotiations without counteroffers. The PA has failed to respond to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s unprecedented attempts to   negotiations aimed at creating a Palestinian state, including freezing Jewish construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem and releasing Palestinian prisoners.

9674,28410,Hillary Clinton’s Campaign Lawyer Goes to Work for Soros-Funded Super PAC,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,2/9/2017,2017,2,,"The lawyer who represented Hillary Clinton’s campaign and her doomed presidential election recount efforts has reportedly joined the board of a progressive super PAC financed by billionaire George Soros and focused in part on issues of voting rights. [CNN reported:  The super PAC Priorities USA has brought Democratic superlawyer Marc Elias onto its board and plans to focus on fighting   GOP efforts to restrict voting access in courts and legislatures. During the most recent presidential election, Priorities USA served as a   super PAC. Soros provided at least $8. 5 million to the group, including $6 million in December 2015 and another $2. 5 million in August 2016, public records show. The Hill reported in January 2016 after Soros’s first contribution: In the last 6 months, the   raised $25. 3 million, meaning that Soros’s contribution accounted for almost a quarter of its fundraising haul. Following the election, Priorities USA is seeking to “reposition itself as a hub of   Democratic activity,” Politico reported last month. Continued Politico on the Super PAC’s new efforts: One of its primary initiatives will also be a push branded as “The BluePrint Project,” which aims to study and engage both voters who backed President Barack Obama in 2012 and then Trump in 2016, and those who supported Obama before staying home this past November. That campaign has already begun: led by pollsters Geoff Garin and Jef Pollock, Priorities will next week convene focus groups in the     states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Florida, focusing on counties that saw the largest swings from Obama to Trump, and the biggest   in voting rates within African American communities. Elias served as the Clinton campaign’s general counsel. In November, he announced Clinton’s losing campaign would participate in Green Party candidate Jill Stein’s recount efforts. Elias is a senior lawyer at the Perkins Coie law firm, which has also represented Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. The lawyer has previously been tied to Soros. In July, the New York Times reported Soros had pledged up to $5 million for a legal fight led by Elias against what the newspaper characterized as “restrictive voting laws enacted in recent years by   state governments. ” The Times further reported on Elias’   efforts: Elias, who specializes in   issues, was in contact with Mr. Soros in January 2014 when Mr. Elias was exploring a series of federal lawsuits before that year’s midterm election and in advance of the 2016 campaign, according to Mr. Soros’s political adviser, Michael Vachon. (Mr. Elias declined to comment on Friday about the funding of the lawsuits.) The goal is to try to influence voting rules in states where Republican governors and   legislatures have enacted election laws since 2010, and to be ready to intervene if additional measures are passed over the next 17 months. At the time, Soros helped pay for two lawsuits in Ohio and Wisconsin, and the billionaire activist contributed funds for suits that, according to the Times, “Mr. Elias and several other groups filed last year in North Carolina. ” In August, the Washington Post spotlighted the   legal work of Elias in a profile titled, “The crusade of a Democratic superlawyer with   backing. ” The newspaper described Elias as the “  lawyer for Democrats in recount fights and redistricting battles. ” The Post reported on Elias’s top benefactor: With a   commitment from liberal   George Soros, Elias is challenging laws that, he argues, diminish the impact of important Democratic Party constituencies of African Americans, Latinos and young people. “I don’t think people should think we’re done filing lawsuits for this election cycle,” Elias said in a taxicab interview after two flights and a   weather delay delivered him to Phoenix. The Post detailed the evolution of Soros’s financial backing: While Elias will not discuss the funding for his project, Soros’s spokesman Michael Vachon said Elias approached them with a set of proposals for challenging state restrictions that would be helpful “up and down the ballot. ” That was appealing to Soros, who began his political giving with voter mobilization efforts, Vachon said. And they agreed with Elias that there was work to be done beyond what the civil rights groups, to which Soros also contributes, were doing.   …     Soros has given $5 million to the trust that funds the litigation, Vachon said, and Elias said he has picked his shots with an eye toward “protecting the Obama coalition” of African Americans, Latinos and young people.

9687,28423,VIDEO: Ex-Obama Staffer Who Urged Spying On Trump Predicted ‘Quick’ Impeachment Weeks Before Election,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,4/4/2017,2017,4,,"TEL AVIV  —   Speaking at a conference two weeks before the 2016 presidential election, Evelyn Farkas, a former top Obama administration official, predicted that if Donald Trump won the presidency he would “be impeached pretty quickly or somebody else would have to take over government,” Breitbart News has found. [Farkas served as deputy assistant secretary of defense under the Obama administration. She has been in the spotlight since the news media last week highlighted comments she made on television that seemed to acknowledge efforts by members of the Obama administration to collect intelligence on Trump and members of his campaign.  Now it has emerged that at on October 26, 2016, Farkas made remarks as a panelist at the annual Warsaw Security Forum predicting Trump’s removal from office “pretty quickly. ” Asked at the event to address the priorities of a future Hillary Clinton administration, Farkas stated: It’s not a done deal, as you said. And so, to the Americans in the audience please vote. And not only vote but get everybody to vote. Because I really believe we need a landslide. We need an absolute repudiation of everything. All of the policies that Donald Trump has put out there. I am not afraid to be political. I am not hiding who I am rooting for. And I think it’s very important that we continue to press forward until election day and through election day to make sure that we have the right results. I do agree however with General Breedlove that even if we have the wrong results from my perspective America is resilient. We have a lot of presidential historians who have put forward very coherent the argument  —   they have given us examples of all of our horrible presidents in the past and the fact that we have endured. And we do have a strong system of checks and balances. And actually, if Donald Trump were elected I believe he would be impeached pretty quickly or somebody else would have to take over government. And I am not even joking. Farkas was referring to General Philip Mark Breedlove, another panelist at the conference who served as Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) of NATO Allied Command Operations.  The panel discussion was about what to expect following the Nov. 8 presidential election. Farkas has also been in the news after remarks she made as a contributor on MSNBC on March 2 resurfaced last week.  In the comments, she said that she told former Obama administration colleagues to collect intelligence on Trump and campaign officials. “I was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill, it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration,” stated Farkas. She continued: Because I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior [Obama] people who left, so it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy   …     that the Trump folks  —   if they found out how we knew what we knew about their   …     the Trump staff dealing with Russians  —   that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we no longer have access to that intelligence. The White House has utilized Farkas’s statements to bolster the charge that Trump was being illicitly surveilled during the campaign. White House Spokesman Sean Spicer last week stated: [I]f you look at Obama’s Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense that is out there, Evelyn Farkas, she made it clear that it was their goal to spread this information around, that they went around and did this.   …     They have admitted on the record that this was their goal  —   to leak stuff. And they literally  —   she said on the record “Trump’s team. ” There are serious questions out there about what happened and why and who did it. And I think that’s really where our focus is in making sure that that information gets out. Farkas, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia until she resigned in 2015. She told the Daily Caller last week that she had no access to any intelligence. “I had no intelligence whatsoever, I wasn’t in government anymore and didn’t have access to any,” she said. Speaking to the Washington Post, Farkas denied being a source of any leaks. The Post reported: Farkas, in an interview with The Post, said she “didn’t give anybody anything except advice,” was not a source for any stories and had nothing to leak. Noting that she left government in October 2015, she said, “I was just watching like anybody else, like a regular spectator” as initial reports of Russia contacts began to surface after the election. Farkas currently serves as a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which takes a hawkish approach toward Russia and has released numerous reports and briefs about Russian aggression. The Council is funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc. the U. S. State Department, and NATO ACT. Another Council funder is the Ploughshares Fund, which in turn has received financing from billionaire George Soros’ Open Society Foundations. Farkas serves on the Atlantic Council alongside Dmitri Alperovitch,   of CrowdStrike, the   company utilized by the FBI to make its assessment about alleged Russian hacking into the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council. Last month, FBI Director James Comey confirmed that his agency never had direct access to the DNC’s servers to confirm the hacking. “Well, we never got direct access to the machines themselves,” he stated. “The DNC in the spring of 2016 hired a firm that ultimately shared with us their forensics from their review of the system. ” National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers also stated the NSA never asked for access to the DNC hardware: “The NSA didn’t ask for access. That’s not in our job. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

9792,28528,Extensive Study Contradicts Hillary Clinton Claim ‘Fake News’ Prompted Election Loss,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,6/1/2017,2017,6,,"Hillary Clinton’s claim on Wednesday that she lost the 2016 presidential election in part because of the proliferation of “fake news” is contradicted by an extensive study that found   fake news didn’t significantly impact the outcome of the election. [That study recently received a positive nod from the Poynter Institute, the group helping Facebook determine whether certain news stories are “disputed. ”  Speaking at the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. Clinton claimed that she lost the election due a plot in which   fake news was disseminated on social media in a conspiracy orchestrated by Russian agents and bots. “Here’s what the other side was doing, and they were in a different arena,” she stated, according to a transcript from the event organizers. “Through content farms, through an enormous investment in falsehoods, fake news, call it what you will. ” Without citing evidence, Clinton claimed that “1, 000 Russian agents” were behind the conspiracy to disseminate fake information about her: The other side was using content that was just   false, and delivering it in a very personalized way, both sort of above the radar screen and below. And you know, look, I’m not a tech expert by any stretch of the imagination. That really influenced the information that people were relying on. And there have been some studies done since the election that if you look  —   let’s pick Facebook. If you look at Facebook, the vast majority of the news items posted were fake. They were connected to, as we now know, the 1, 000 Russian agents who were involved in delivering those messages. Clinton’s claim that voters were influenced by   fake news contrasts with a study titled “Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election,”   by economists Matthew Gentzkow of Stanford University and Hunt Allcott of New York University. The research utilized web browsing data, a database of what the authors claimed were fake news stories and a   online survey about news trends. The study concluded: Our data suggest that social media were not the most important source of election news, and even the most widely circulated fake news stories were seen by only a small fraction of Americans. For fake news to have changed the outcome of the election, a single fake news story would need to have convinced about 0. 7 percent of Clinton voters and   who saw it to shift their votes to Trump, a persuasion rate equivalent to seeing 36 television campaign ads. Poynter’s Chief Media Writer James Warren reported on the study: In sum, they conclude that the role of social media was overstated, with television remaining by far the primary vehicle for consuming political news. Just 14 percent of Americans deemed social media the primary source of their campaign news, according to their research. In addition, while fake news that favored Trump far exceeded that favoring Clinton, few Americans actually recalled the specifics of the stories and fewer believed them. “For fake news to have changed the outcome of the election, a single fake article would need to have had the same persuasive effect as 36 television campaign ads,” they conclude.

9807,28543,NBC’s Lester Holt Interrupts Trump Nine Times in Less Than Three Minutes,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,5/11/2017,2017,5,,"NBCNews. com on Thursday posted a two minute and 34 second preview clip of anchor Lester Holt’s exclusive   with President Donald Trump. The clip features Holt conducting an   interview in which the NBC personality interrupted Trump nine times and spoke over the president on many of those occasions. [The short clip is part of a   White House interview set to air Thursday night on NBC Nightly News.   In the clip, Holt can be seen questioning almost every statement made by Trump. In one instance, Holt asked Trump about his May 9 letter ousting F. B. I Director James Comey in which Trump wrote, “I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation. ” Holt asked Trump, “Why did you put that in there?” Trump replied, “Because he told me that. I mean, he told me  …    ” Before Trump could finish his sentence, Holt interrupted, asking, “He told you you weren’t under investigation regarding the Russian investigation?” “Yeah, and I’ve heard that from others. I think  …    ” Trump began to respond before Holt interrupted again. “Was it in a phone call? Did you meet   ?” Holt interjected, speaking over Trump. “I had a dinner with him. He wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on. We had a very nice dinner at the White House  …    ” Holt spoke over Trump again, interrupting this time by asking, “He, he asked for the dinner?” “A dinner was arranged. I think he asked for a dinner. ” Holt interrupted Trump again when Trump was explaining he knew that he wasn’t under investigation both from Comey three times and from a “committee level. ” “So that didn’t come directly from him?” Holt cut in and asked before Trump could finish his explanation about the times he says he heard from Comey that he wasn’t under investigation.

9838,28574,Latest Establishment Talking Point: Trump May Be Guilty of ’Treason’  ,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,3/27/2017,2017,3,,"TEL AVIV  —   Over the past week, numerous Democratic Party operatives and establishment pundits have used the word “treason” in a seeming attempt to smear President Donald Trump over unproven claims of collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. [On Monday, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign manager, Robby Mook, demanded Trump’s campaign aides be “prosecuted for treason” if evidence emerges of coordination with Moscow during the recent presidential campaign.  One day later, on Tuesday, Michael Winship, senior writer for BillMoyers. com, wrote an opinion piece titled, “‘There’s a Smell of Treason in the Air’” Winship is a former senior writing fellow at the progressive advocacy group Demos, which is financed by billionaire George Soros. Winship’s piece, which was republished at the Huffington Post, argued that last Monday’s House Intelligence Committee hearing that probed alleged ties between the Trump administration and Russia was “proof positive of the absolute need for both a special prosecutor and an independent, bipartisan commission with subpoena power to conduct a full investigation” on the matter. Last week, this reporter found serious problems with the main   charges at the hearing, delivered in opening remarks by Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on a House intelligence committee. The charges included wild conspiracy theories and heavy reliance on a questionable source. The title of Winship’s article, meanwhile, comes from a quote in the Washington Post last week provided by presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, who told the newspaper, “There’s a smell of treason in the air. Imagine if J. Edgar Hoover or any other FBI director would have testified against a sitting president? It would have been a mindboggling event. ” Winship went on to compare the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to the Watergate scandal under the Nixon administration: During Schiff’s questioning on Monday, Comey seemed to nod toward agreeing that Russia’s hacking of the Democratic National Committee was not unlike the 1972 physical   at the DNC. You know, the one that precipitated the revelations, resignations and prison convictions of Watergate. Drip, drip, drip  …     On Thursday, Nicholas Kristof wrote an oped in the New York Times using the same title as Winship, also citing Brinkley’s quotes to the Washington Post. Kristof starts off his piece, titled, “‘There’s a Smell of Treason in the Air,’” by citing President Richard Nixon: The greatest political scandal in American history was not Aaron Burr’s shooting of Alexander Hamilton, and perhaps wasn’t even Watergate. Rather it may have been Richard Nixon’s secret efforts in 1968 to sabotage a U. S. diplomatic effort to end the Vietnam War. Nixon’s initiative, long rumored but confirmed only a few months ago, was meant to improve his election chances that year. After Nixon won, the war dragged on and cost thousands of additional American and Vietnamese lives it’s hard to see his behavior as anything but treason. Like Winship, Kristof tries to link Trump to Nixon in order to make the “treason” argument. “Now the F. B. I. confirms that we have had an investigation underway for eight months into whether another presidential campaign colluded with a foreign power so as to win an election,” Kristof wrote. “To me, that too would amount to treason. ” Kristof relied on his own “intelligence experts” who “mostly (but not entirely) believe” that there is a   connection. He wrote: I’ve been speaking to intelligence experts, Americans and foreigners alike, and they mostly (but not entirely) believe there was   cooperation of some kind. But this is uncertain it’s prudent to note that James Clapper, the intelligence director under Barack Obama, said that as of January he had seen no evidence of collusion but that he favors an investigation to get to the bottom of it. Kristof claimed he was “told (not by a Democrat!) that there’s a persuasive piece of intelligence on ties between Russia and a member of the Trump team that isn’t yet public. ” Kristof speculated the “most likely scenario for collusion seems fuzzier and less transactional than many Democrats anticipate. ” Despite there being no evidence of significant Trump investments in Russia, Kristof then guesses at what it might be  —   alleged Trump investments in Russia: The Russians for years had influence over Donald Trump because of their investments with him, and he was by nature inclined to admire Vladimir Putin as a strongman ruler. Meanwhile, Trump had in his orbit a number of people with Moscow ties, including Paul Manafort, who practically bleeds borscht. The Times’ columnist goes on to channel Winship and also demand the same talking point  —   a “public and bipartisan investigation by an independent commission. ” On cue, Rep. Ted Lieu ( ) warned Friday of a “cloud of treason” hanging over the Trump administration. “The bombshell revelation that US officials have information that suggests Trump associates may have colluded with the Russians means we must pause the entire Trump agenda,” he said. Lieu called for the “total and complete” shutdown of Trump’s legislative agenda in the wake of the claims. “We may have an illegitimate President of the United States currently occupying the White House,” Lieu said in a statement. “Congress cannot continue regular order and must stop voting on any   agenda item until the FBI completes its   collusion investigation. ” Lieu made similar “treason” comments on Twitter. Cloud of treason means we must have total shutdown of any @POTUS agenda item. No votes on any item. My stmt https:  .  #GetWoke,  —   Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 23, 2017,  Last week, Lieu also tweeted to Trump: “You truly are an evil man  …    ” ”President” @realDonaldTrump: You truly are an evil man. Your job is to help Americans. Not intentionally try to destroy their lives. https:  .   —   Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 25, 2017,  Writing in the Washington Post on Friday, Jennifer Palmieri, Director of Communications for Clinton’s presidential campaign, also referenced “treason” but from a different angle. “If Clinton had won with the help of the Russians, the Republicans would have impeachment proceedings underway for treason,” she contended. “No doubt. Instead, dealing with Russia falls nearly solely on Democrats’ shoulders. ” To Palmieri, the case is already closed. She writes that Trump won because of a Russian “plot” as if it were an established fact. “Now that Trump is president, though, the stakes are higher because the Russian plot succeeded,” Palmieri claims. Like Winship and Kristof, Palmieri references Watergate to make her point: “The possibility of collusion between Trump’s allies and Russian intelligence is much more serious than Watergate. It is a constitutional crisis. It represents a violation of our republic’s most sacred trust. ” Writing in The Week on Friday, senior correspondent Damon Linker also claims Trump could be guilty of “treason. ” Here is what I can’t understand: FBI Director James Comey testified on Monday that Donald Trump’s presidential campaign is under investigation by the FBI over its potential ties to Russia. Let’s be clear about what this might mean: treason. We don’t yet know what the outcome of the investigation will be (though subsequent press reports have certainly underlined the importance of seeing it through to the end). But the very possibility that a sitting president and his circle could end up credibly accused of having advanced the interests of a hostile foreign power and of having colluded with that power in an effort to undermine the campaign of the president’s political opponent should be more than enough to persuade Republican officeholders and pundits to treat the investigation with utmost seriousness  —   and to distance themselves from the man at the center of the investigation until such time as he is cleared of any wrongdoing. And like the others, Linker likens the Russia claims to “Watergate” to advance the “treason” narrative. Finally, there’s the relative gravity of the allegations in the two scandals. The Watergate   itself was obviously a crime, but what led to Nixon’s downfall was the   which implicated the president in multiple acts of obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress. That would have been more than enough to impeach Nixon, remove him from office, and indict him. Bad? You bet. But far from treason. The allegations swirling around the Trump campaign are far more serious. Also on Friday, journalist Carl Bernstein  —   who is known for breaking the Watergate story in 1972  —   slammed Trump as “more treacherous” than Nixon. Meanwhile, former Bill Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who has been working closely with the   MoveOn. org, penned a piece published in Newsweek arguing Trump’s Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch “shouldn’t be confirmed until Trump comes clean” about alleged ties to Russia. Like Lieu’s reference to a “cloud of treason” hanging over the Trump administration, Reich claimed a “true cloud of illegitimacy now hangs over the presidency of Donald Trump. ” Reich’s piece was followed up by a MoveOn. org petition calling for Trump’s agenda to be “shut down” while he is investigated over the Russia claims. The petition states: “Congress must pause all   legislation and appointments —  starting with a halt to Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation process —  until the American people learn the full truth about Trump and Russia. ” In recent days, the hashtag #TrumpTreason has been trending on Twitter. Prominent users of the hashtag include Trump critic Rosie O’Donnell, how about  —   SCOTUS APPOINTMENTS SUSPENDED  —   TIL THE INVESTIGATION IS OVER  —   #TRUMPTREASON https:  .   —   ROSIE (@Rosie) March 20, 2017,  This is not the first time this reporter documented the theme of   parroting similar   talking points. In February, a trend emerged in which news media outlets featured articles quoting health care professionals who questioned the billionaire’s mental stability in a seeming bid to delegitimize the president. Following those reports, some Democratic politicians  —   and at least one Republican  —   called for Trump to be subjected to a psychiatric examination to determine whether he was fit for office. Some commentators have even suggested invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, which allows for the   ’s removal from office if the “president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

9982,28718,James Comey Denied Leaking Under Oath — Days Before Leak from One-on-One Dinner with Trump,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,5/12/2017,2017,5,,"How things have changed. Only nine days ago, James Comey, then director of the FBI, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on FBI oversight that he had never been an anonymous source for news reports related to the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race. [Comey further testified that he never authorized anyone else at the FBI to serve as an anonymous source in news media coverage of that investigation or the agency’s probe into Hillary Clinton’s private email server.  Fast forward to yesterday. The New York Times published intimate details allegedly from inside a    dinner at the White House between Comey and Trump that took place seven days after the president was sworn in. The article quoted liberally from “two people who have heard [Comey’s] account of the dinner” in what seems to be a leak from Comey’s camp to fight back after Trump fired Comey earlier this week.  At one point in the article, the Times describes the sources as “associates” of Comey’s. The White House disputed the Times’ dinner account, which claims that Trump asked Comey to pledge loyalty to him. “We don’t believe this to be an accurate account,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary, told the Times. “The integrity of our law enforcement agencies and their leadership is of the utmost importance to President Trump. He would never even suggest the expectation of personal loyalty, only loyalty to our country and its great people. ” Trump also tweeted the following warning about Comey leaking to the news media. James Comey better hope that there are no ”tapes” of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017,  The alleged leaks follow Comey’s May 3 testimony in which he steadfastly denied aiding in leaks to the news media regarding the FBI’s investigations into alleged Russian interference or the Clinton email probe. The denials came during the following exchange with Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley ( ): GRASSLEY: And thank you for your opening statement. I’m going to start out probably with a couple subjects you wish I didn’t bring up, and then a third one that I think everybody needs to hear your opinion on on a policy issue. It is frustrating when the FBI refuses to answer this committee’s questions, but leaks relevant information to the media. In other words, they don’t talk to us, but somebody talks to the media. Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation? COMEY: Never. GRASSLEY: Question two, relatively related, have you ever authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?

10015,28751,Obama’s Organizing for Action Partners with Soros-Linked ‘Indivisible’ to Disrupt Trump’s Agenda,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,2/19/2017,2017,2,,"Organizing for Action, the activist group that morphed from Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, has partnered with the   Indivisible Project for “online trainings” on how to protest President Donald Trump’s agenda. [Last week, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by billionaire George Soros.  Politico earlier this month profiled Indivisible in an article titled, “Inside the protest movement that has Republicans reeling. ”  The news agency not only left out the Soros links, but failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisible’s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire, as Breitbart News documented. Organizing for Action (OFA) is a   community organizing project that sprung from Obama’s 2012 campaign organization, Organizing for America, becoming a nonprofit described by the Washington Post as “advocate[ing] for the president’s policies. ” In a recent Facebook post titled, “Take a deep breath. Then take action,” OFA called on constituents to lobby particularly hard between now and February 26, when lawmakers will be in their home districts. The post included a link to a guide released by Indivisible on how to organize against Trump. “Stay tuned for online trainings and invitations to calls with coalition partners like Indivisible Guide,” the OFA post states. Paul Sperry, writing at the New York Post, relates: The manual, published with OFA partner “Indivisible,” advises protesters to go into halls quietly so as not to raise alarms, and “grab seats at the front of the room but do not all sit together. ” Rather, spread out in pairs to make it seem like the whole room opposes the Republican host’s positions. “This will help reinforce the impression of broad consensus. ” It also urges them to ask “hostile” questions  —   while keeping “a firm hold on the mic”  —   and loudly boo the the GOP politician if he isn’t “giving you real answers. ” “Express your concern [to the event’s hosts] they are giving a platform to   authoritarianism, racism, and corruption,” it says.   …    “Even the safest [Republican] will be deeply alarmed by signs of organized opposition,” the document states, “because these actions create the impression that they’re not connected to their district and not listening to their constituents. ” Sperry reported OFA “plans to stage 400 rallies across 42 states this year to attack Trump and Republicans over ObamaCare’s repeal. ” Earlier this month, NBC News reported on OFA’s new actions and its partnership with Indivisible: OFA has hired 14 field organizers in states home to key senators as part of its campaign to defend Obama’s signature healthcare law. To run that campaign, the group hired Saumya Narechania  —   the former national field director at Enroll America, which worked to sign people up for Obamacare  —   and a deputy campaign manager.   …    OFA says more than 1, 800 people have applied to its Spring Community Engagement Fellowship, a   training program,   of whom have not previously been involved with OFA. And the group has teamed up with Indivisible, a buzzy newcomer to the progressive movement, to offer organizing training that began Thursday night with a video conference. A combined 25, 000 people have registered to participate in those trainings, OFA said. Indivisible’s DC branch was implicated in a scuffle last week that reportedly injured a    staffer for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( ) as well as reportedly knocking a    to the ground.  Protesters claimed they were only delivering Valentine’s Day cards. Indivisible is a part of a coalition of activist groups slated to hold a massive   Tax March in Washington and at least 60 other locations on April 15. Unreported by the news media is that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by Soros or have close links to Soros financing, as Breitbart News documented last week. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Politico profiled Indivisible and reported that “conservatives” are “spreading unfounded rumors” that the group is “being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros. ” Politico, however, seemingly failed to do even the most minimal research on the Indivisible leaders cited in the news outlet’s own profile.  Some of those personalities are openly associated with groups financed by Soros. Politico further failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisible’s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire. Citing Angel Padilla, a   of the group, Politico reported: Dubbed “Indivisible,” the group launched as a way for Padilla and a handful of fellow   aides to channel their   heartbreak into a manual for quashing President Donald Trump’s agenda. They drafted a   protest guide for activists, full of pointers on how to bird dog their members of Congress in the language of Capitol insiders. The manual has since been downloaded over one million times. Indivisible says on its website that over 4, 500 local groups across the nation have “signed up to resist the Trump agenda in nearly every congressional district in the country. ” The manual has been utilized to form the basis of a protest movement. The group’s website states: “What’s more, you all are putting the guide into action —  showing up en masse to congressional district offices and events, and flooding the congressional phone lines. You’re resisting —  and it’s working. ” Politico reported on “unfounded” rumors being spread about Soros’s involvement with Indivisible (emphasis added by this reporter): Its handful of senior leaders count about 100 contributors to their national organizing work but insist that all are working on a volunteer basis. They know conservatives are spreading unfounded rumors that their success is being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros, which they flatly deny. That paragraph was followed by the following quote from   Padilla (emphasis again added by this reporter): “It doesn’t matter who we take money from  —   we’re always going to get blamed as a Soros group, even if we don’t take money from Soros,” said Padilla, now an analyst with the National Immigration Law Center. “That’s one of the attacks and that’s fine. ” While “Indivisible” has yet to disclose its donors, Politico failed to inform readers that the National Immigration Law Center where the news outlet reported Padilla serves as an analyst is financed by Soros’s Open Society Foundations. The Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support. Also unmentioned by Politico is that Padilla previously served as an immigration policy consultant at the radical National Council of La Raza. Soros is a major La Raza donor. Politico went on to detail how Indivisible has been aided by MoveOn. org and the ACLU.  The news website failed to tell readers that MoveOn. org and the ACLU are both financed by Soros, a relevant tidbit given Politico’s claim about “unfounded rumors” that Indivisibles’ success was being driven by Soros .  The news website reported: In addition, MoveOn. org and the Working Families Party joined with Indivisible for its first nationwide call on Jan. 22. Nearly 60, 000 people phoned in that day, according to Levin and MoveOn organizing director Victoria Kaplan. Indivisible estimates that its second national call, on the impact of Trump’s immigration order with assistance from the ACLU and Padilla’s group, drew 35, 000 people. Politico also missed that, according to its Twitter account, another organizer of the conference call with MoveOn. org was the International Refugee Assistance Project, a project of the Urban Justice Center, another recipient of an Open Society grant. Taryn Higashi, executive director of the Center’s International Refugee Assistance Project, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Soros’s Open Society Foundations. Politico further reported on Indivisible’s ties to the organizers of last month’s   Women’s March while failing to mention that Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 “partners” of that march. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leaders’ own close associations with Soros. Regarding Indivisible and the Women’s March, Politico reported: Indivisible is also embracing collaboration with other major   protest outlets. Leaders of the group were in communication with Women’s March organizers before their main event on Jan. 21, and that partnership will become official when the March unveils the third in its series of 10 direct actions that attendees have been asked to pursue in their communities. Another Indivisible leader mentioned in the Politico article is Jeremy Haile. Not reported by Politico is that is Haile served as federal advocacy counsel for the Sentencing Project.  The Sentencing Project is reportedly financed by Soros’s Open Society Foundations, which has also hosted the Project to promote its cause.

10236,28972,Report: George Soros Tied to More Than 50 ‘Partners’ of Anti-Trump Women’s March,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,1/23/2017,2017,1,,"Billionaire George Soros has provided financing to or has close relationships with at least 56 “partners” of Saturday’s “Women’s March on Washington,” according to a report at a website affiliated with the New York Times. [Writing the website for Women in the World, a summit in a joint venture with The New York Times, former Wall Street Journal reporter Asra Q. Nomani relates her findings on the Soros ties to the march.  The Women in the World site is hosted by the Times.  By my draft research, which I’m opening up for   on GoogleDocs, Soros has funded, or has close relationships with, at least 56 of the march’s “partners,” including “key partners” Planned Parenthood, which opposes Trump’s   policy, and the National Resource Defense Council, which opposes Trump’s environmental policies. The other Soros ties with “Women’s March” organizations include the partisan MoveOn. org (which was fiercely  ) the National Action Network (which has a former executive director lauded by Obama senior advisor Valerie Jarrett as “a leader of tomorrow” as a march   and another official as “the head of logistics”). Other Soros grantees who are “partners” in the march are the American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Constitutional Rights, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. March organizers and the organizations identified here haven’t yet returned queries for comment. In response to the report, a spokeswoman for Soros’s Open Society Foundations released a statement  —   included in an update to Nomani’s article  —   denying the group was “funding protests” in the wake of the presidential election.  Nomani, however, did not charge that Soros was funding protests she documented the numerous   groups that were “partners” to the protest march. The Open Society statement reads: “There have been many false reports about George Soros and the Open Society Foundations funding protests in the wake of the U. S. presidential elections. There is no truth to these reports. We support a wide range of organizations  —   including those that support women and minorities who have historically been denied equal rights. Many of whom are concerned about what policy changes may lie ahead. We are proud of their work. We of course support the right of all Americans to peaceably assemble and petition their government —  a vital, and constitutionally safeguarded, pillar of a functioning democracy. ” Last week, Breitbart News reported the march is backed by a who’s who of   organizations, including scores of groups financed by Soros. Activists Gloria Steinem and Harry Belafonte are serving as honorary  . In 2005, Belafonte founded the Gathering for Justice group, which has since been the recipient of numerous grants from Soros’ Open Society Foundations. Open Society also supported the New York production of a play starring Belafonte titled “The Exonerated” about wrongly convicted death row inmates. Soros’ foundation sponsored a series of “talk back” conversions after the play “where justice advocates and death penalty experts from across the country will speak and field questions from the theater audience. ” Belafonte serves on the board of the Advancement Project, which was one of four primary recipients of money from a group created in 2008 called the Election Administration Fund. The Fund reportedly raised between $5. 1 million —  $1 million from Soros’ Open Society Institute. Meanwhile, the official partner’s list for the Women’s March on Washington reads like a who’s who of the   including groups such as CODEPINK, the Southern Poverty Law Center and 350. org. Many of the march “partners” are financed by Soros, including: Sierra Club, Amnesty International, MoveOn. org, NAACP, Green For All, Center for Constitutional Rights, Human Rights Watch, MoveOn. org, NARAL   People for the American Way and Planned Parenthood.

10253,28989,"EXCLUSIVE – Juanita Broaddrick Slams Madonna, ‘Fake News’ Women’s March - Breitbart",Breitbart,Aaron Klein,1/22/2017,2017,1,,"Juanita Broaddrick, the woman who accused Bill Clinton of raping her twice in a hotel room in 1978, slammed Madonna and other celebrities for leading a women’s march against Donald Trump yesterday while ignoring the plight of Clinton’s female sexual assault accusers during the presidential election. [Broaddrick, who charged that Hillary Clinton tried to silence her about the alleged rape, further labeled yesterday’s women’s march “just more a part of the fake news that they are trying to perpetuate. ”  “And their rhetoric,” added Broaddrick.  “They are so disappointing. ”  She was speaking on this reporter’s Sunday talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast in New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. Regarding Madonna, who delivered a     speech at yesterday’s event, Broaddrick stated: “I could never take her seriously. She, or when Meryl Streep spoke out. I could never take any of them seriously. Because they did not take us seriously. ” Continued Broaddrick: “None of these women have ever stood up for the women who were abused and raped by Bill Clinton. We’ve never gotten any support. I do not understand it. I mean, you don’t support an evil candidate just because she is a woman. And to me that is all this amounts to, Aaron. Is their candidate who was absolutely corrupt lost to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump is the only one that stood up for us.   …    ”It’s unbelievable. That they didn’t come out for the women that were against their candidate. The women that were abused by Bill Clinton. It’s still unbelievable. If it weren’t so sad it is almost laughable. I don’t understand why they do not support us. I don’t understand it. ” Time reported on Madonna’s speech at the women’s march: “To our detractors that insist that this march will never add up to anything, f —   you,” Madonna said. The singer said the expletive three times during her speech at the march, saying it took “this horrific moment of darkness to wake the f —  k up. ” The “Vogue” singer said marginalized communities would be under threat during the Trump administration, which is why hundreds of thousands of women took to the streets in protest. “Yes I am outraged,” she said. “Yes I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House, but I know that this won’t change anything. We cannot fall into despair. ” The mission statement for yesterday’s march claims that the gathering is meant to send a message “that women’s rights are human rights” and pledges to fight against those who have demonized “survivors of sexual assault. ” Last October, Breitbart News released an exclusive video interview in which Broaddrick recounted what she described as the   experience of being raped by Clinton. The YouTube video has since garnered over one million views. Watch it here: In another Breitbart News exclusive video, Broaddrick recounted an alleged encounter with Hillary Clinton in which Broaddrick says the future presidential candidate attempted to intimidate her into being silent about the alleged rapes. Broaddrick said she believed that Hillary Clinton knew that her husband had raped her during their encounter.

10351,29087,Seven Major Problems with James Comey’s Credibility,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,5/19/2017,2017,5,,"TEL AVIV  —   Earlier this week, the New York Times reported that President Donald Trump tried during a private meeting to convince   Director James Comey to drop an investigation into Michael Flynn, who was fired as national security adviser. [The charge, strongly denied by the White House, relies on a memo the Times reported was written by Comey shortly after the meeting with Trump, propelling the issue of the fired FBI chief’s credibility to centerstage.   Below, in no particular order, are seven significant problems with Comey’s credibility:     Comey repeatedly failed to seek the recusal of Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch from the Hillary Clinton email probe despite his reported concerns about her partiality. In an extensive article published last month that included interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement officials, congressional officials and other government employees, the New York Times reported on numerous major concerns Comey had about Lynch’s intentions toward the Clinton email probe.  According to the report, Comey was aware of the existence of a document written by a Democratic operative that allegedly indicated Lynch would have protected Clinton in the email probe. The newspaper reported that “Mr. Comey believed (Lynch) had subtly helped play down the Clinton investigation. ” Adding even more intrigue to the matter, the FBI had further information that the alleged Lynch document had been hacked by Russian intelligence, leading Comey to fear that Moscow could leak the document to call into question the independence of the U. S. government’s Clinton email probe, the Times reported. Yet Comey didn’t seek Lynch’s recusal. The Times further reported on Comey’s concerns after Lynch’s infamous tarmac meeting at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the FBI’s main subject in a criminal probe, boarded the attorney general’s plane and reportedly stayed there for about 20 minutes. In a letter sent earlier this month from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending that Comey be fired, Rosenstein admonished Comey for failing to seek Lynch’s recusal from the Clinton email probe and instead bypassing the Justice Department to make public pronouncements about the case. “The Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed Attorney General Lynch had a conflict,” Rosenstein wrote. “But the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department. There is a   process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General. ”   Comey violated FBI tradition, bypassed the Justice Department and went rogue on several occasions in a manner that clearly impacted the 2016 presidential election. Instead of seeking Lynch’s recusal, as outlined above, Comey decided to go at it alone on the Clinton email probe, taking matters into his own hands and making his public pronouncements about Clinton’s email case without the Justice Department. He did this at an infamous news conference on July 5, 2016 at which Comey criticized Clinton’s private email server as “extremely careless” before finally stating that “no charges are appropriate in this case. ”  The Times‘ extensive April 22 report cited former Justice officials as “deeply skeptical” of Comey’s alleged reasoning that he took the public lead because Lynch was compromised: Former Justice Department officials are deeply skeptical of this account. If Mr. Comey believed that Ms. Lynch were compromised, they say, why did he not seek her recusal? Mr. Comey never raised this issue with Ms. Lynch or the deputy attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, former officials said. Mr. Comey’s defenders regard this as one of the untold stories of the Clinton investigation, one they say helps explain his  . But former Justice Department officials say the F. B. I. never uncovered evidence tying Ms. Lynch to the document’s author, and are convinced that Mr. Comey wanted an excuse to put himself in the spotlight. Comey’s injection into the presidential race did not end there. Less than two weeks before the election, the FBI discovered a trove of Clinton emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner. Some of the emails, according to reports, originated on Clinton’s old BlackBerry server that she used before setting up her private home server and some believe may have contained the deleted messages. Comey’s decision this time centered on whether to follow FBI tradition and keep quiet about the reopening of the case, or inform Congress about the ongoing investigation, which, the Times related, “everyone acknowledged would create a political furor. ” Eventually, Comey decided to go rogue again and inform Congress. Lynch was against the decision, the Times reported, and the Justice Department implored the FBI not to impact the presidential campaign in its final days. The Times added that “even at the F. B. I. agents who supported their   director were stunned. ” “Career prosecutors and political appointees” at the Justice Department quietly criticized not only Comey but Lynch for failing to stop the FBI director, the Times documented. A chorus of former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general from across the political spectrum publicly criticized Comey’s move.   Comey made legal pronouncements about Clinton’s email case. Comey’s July 5 press conference first stated Clinton was “extremely careless” with her email server and then took the highly unusual step of declaring that “no charges are appropriate in this case. ” With his pronouncements, Comey offered judgments and legal conclusions many argue are out of the purview of the FBI, which is charged with documenting evidence and handing it over to the Justice Department. The Times, in its April 22 report, cited unnamed “frustrated” prosecutors at the Justice Department complaining that Comey should have first consulted with them.   Comey reportedly allowed Lynch to persuade him into publicly minimizing the FBI’s criminal investigation into Clinton’s email server. According to the same extensive April 22 report in the New York Times, Lynch, an Obama appointee, convinced Comey to use the word “matter” instead of “investigation” when the FBI director publicly addressed the criminal investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server. This despite the Justice Department knowing the FBI probe was not only an official investigation but a criminal investigation. Comey reportedly caved in and called the investigation a “matter” even though the Times documented his concerns about Lynch’s intentions toward Clinton. The Times reported on a meeting between FBI and Justice officials at which, according to the newspaper’s characterization, “Lynch told him (Comey) to be even more circumspect: Do not even call it an investigation, she said, according to three people who attended the meeting. Call it a ‘matter. ’” Continued the Times’ report: Ms. Lynch reasoned that the word “investigation” would raise other questions: What charges were being investigated? Who was the target? But most important, she believed that the department should stick by its policy of not confirming investigations. It was a    decision. But Mr. Comey and other F. B. I. officials regarded it as disingenuous in an investigation that was so widely known. And Mr. Comey was concerned that a Democratic attorney general was asking him to be misleading and line up his talking points with Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, according to people who spoke with him afterward. As the meeting broke up, George Z. Toscas, a national security prosecutor, ribbed Mr. Comey. “I guess you’re the Federal Bureau of Matters now,” Mr. Toscas said, according to two people who were there. Even though Comey reportedly had concerns about Lynch’s motivations, he went along and did not call the criminal investigation an investigation. “I am confident we have the resources and the personnel assigned to the matter,” Comey stated mere days after the meeting with Lynch.   Comey denied leaking under oath  —   days before leaks from a    dinner with Trump. In his testimony earlier this month, Comey portrayed himself as someone who does not leak information to the news media, denying he had ever been an anonymous source for news reports related to the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race.  Comey further testified that he never authorized anyone else at the FBI to serve as an anonymous source in news media coverage of that investigation or the agency’s probe into Hillary Clinton’s private email server. Nine days later, after Comey’s firing, the New York Times published intimate details allegedly from inside a    dinner at the White House between Comey and Trump that took place seven days after the president was sworn in.  The article quoted liberally from “two people who have heard [Comey’s] account of the dinner” in what seems to be a leak from Comey’s camp to fight back after he was fired by Trump. At one point in the article, the Times describes the sources as “associates” of Comey’s. The White House disputed the Times’ dinner account, which claims that Trump asked Comey to pledge loyalty to him. That leak was followed up by another   leak, first published by the New York Times, claiming that Trump attempted during a private meeting to convince Comey to drop the investigation into Flynn.  6 —   Comey was accused of mischaracterizing Huma Abedin’s role regarding emails found by the FBI on Anthony Weiner’s laptop. Speaking under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on FBI oversight, Comey stated that Hillary Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin “forwarded hundreds and thousands” of emails to the laptop of her estranged husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner. That mischaracterization prompted the FBI to release a supplement to clarify Comey’s statement. CNN reported on the supplement to Comey’s testimony:  The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI’s Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the “hundreds of thousands of emails” that Comey said were “forwarded” from Abedin to her husband’s email “included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding. ”   …     While some of those emails may have been sent directly from Huma in order to be printed, officials told CNN, the number was far fewer than the amount Comey described. The FBI confirmed the distinction in its letter Tuesday, which read: “Although we do not know the exact numbers, based on its investigation, the FBI believes it is reasonable to conclude that most of the emails found on Mr. Weiner’s laptop computer related to the Clinton investigation occurred as a result of a backup of personal electronic devices, with a small number a result of manual forwarding by Ms. Abedin to Mr. Weiner. ” 7  —   Comey reportedly allowed the Obama administration to “shut down” a request to publicize the Russia probe last summer, raising questions about political motives. In March, Newsweek reported that Comey first wanted to go public as early as the summer of 2016 about the agency’s information on alleged Russian interference in the presidential campaign. However, Obama administration officials blocked Comey from making public statements, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter speaking to Newsweek. “The White House shut it down,” one source told the magazine, explaining that Comey had pitched the idea of writing an oped about the subject during a White House Situation Room meeting in June or July. “He had a draft of it or an outline. He held up a piece of paper in a meeting and said, ‘I want to go forward. What do people think of this? ’” the source said.  The source told Newsweek the meeting was attended by Secretary of State John Kerry, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and National Security Adviser Susan Rice. Continued the report: But many in the room didn’t like the idea, and White House officials thought the announcement should be a coordinated message backed by multiple agencies, the source says. “An   doesn’t have the same stature.

10354,29090,Soros-Financed Groups Unite to Sue for Trump White House Visitor Logs - Breitbart,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,4/14/2017,2017,4,,"Three   government watchdog groups have reportedly banded together to sue the Department of Homeland Security for the release the logs of visitors to the White House and to President Trump’s homes in both  New York and Florida. [Unreported in the news media coverage of the lawsuit is that two of the three organizations are directly funded by billionaire George Soros’s Open Society Foundations while the third group is the project of a fund that has financed leftist groups along with Soros.  Politico, which first reported on the   lawsuit, documented: The suit, set to be filed Monday in federal court in New York, contends that the Secret Service is in violation of the law by failing to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests for details on visitors to the White House and other locations where Trump has spent time since taking office.   …     By filing in New York rather than in Washington, where most FOIA suits are filed, the plaintiffs may be trying to avoid having the case scuttled by a key legal precedent already on the books that sharply limits the public’s right to see logs of visitors to the White House complex. The three organizations that filed the complaint are the National Security Archive, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Government (CREW) which Politico notes was also involved in a   lawsuit for government records. The National Security Archive documents on the “funders and support” section of its website that it is funded by Soros’s Open Society Institute  as well as the Open Society Fund, Inc. CREW, the second group that is party to the visitor logs lawsuit, describes itself as an organization that utilizes “  legal actions to target government officials who sacrifice the common good to special interests. ” CREW, which does not publicize its donor list, has received financing from Soros’s Open Society Foundations. According to Discover the Networks, CREW has also been funded by the   Tides Foundation. In August 2014, longtime Hillary Clinton ally David Brock, founder of the heavily   Media Matters for America progressive group, was elected chairman of CREW’s board. Brock departed the organization last December, but Politico reported in January that CREW is part of a network of groups for which the activist is attempting to raise $40 million to take on Trump.  Also in January, CREW filed a lawsuit claiming that Trump is in violation of a Constitutional clause banning government officials from accepting benefits from foreign nations.  The third organization suing for the visitor logs is the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.  The Institute, a $60 million effort, was launched last year by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation together with Columbia University.  Numerous Knight Foundation projects are also financed by Soros. The Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas at the University of Texas at Austin, for example, was also the recipient of a $270, 000 grant from Soros’s Open Society Foundations.  The Knight Foundation and the Open Society both fund the ProPublica journalism project.  The two charities are also founding sponsors of the New Americans Campaign, which says it seeks to “help modernize naturalization assistance in the United States and help more lawful permanent immigrants become U. S. citizens. ”  Since Trump took office,   groups have been leading a constant effort to thwart the U. S. president’s policies, as this reporter has thoroughly documented. In one of many examples, tomorrow a coalition of activist groups plans to hold a massive   Tax March in Washington and at least 60 other locations.  Unreported by much of the news media is that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by Soros or have close links to Soros financing.  One Tax March organizer is the   Indivisible Project, which has been helping to lead   activism nationwide. Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by Soros.  Soros reportedly also has ties to more than 50 “partners” of the   Women’s March that was held the day after Trump’s inauguration. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leaders’ own close associations with Soros. In February, Breitbart News reported a   group distributed an actual script with   talking points for citizens to use when meeting with constituents in town halls, including during last week’s Congressional recess.   The script provided    language suggestions that accuse the Trump administration of “xenophobia, racism, and Islamophobia. ”  It asked activists to use the descriptors to petition their representatives to “forcefully condemn” and support legislation opposing Trump’s immigration and border security agendas.  In January, immigration lawyers from groups financed by Soros, a champion of open border policies, were signatories to a lawsuit that successfully blocked Trump’s original executive order halting visas for 90 days for “immigrants and  ” from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Iran, and Iraq.

10358,29094,Fake News: Hysterical Media Hype Tiny Tel Aviv Anti-Trump Protest,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,1/30/2017,2017,1,,"TEL AVIV  —   Despite only attracting a crowd of about 40, the news media has been hyping a tiny protest outside of the U. S. Embassy in Tel Aviv against President Donald Trump’s temporary halt on refugees while the government revamps its flawed security screening process. [Here are some of the screaming headlines about the miniscule protest:  L. A. Times: “Protesters in Tel Aviv compare Trump immigration order to Israeli refugee policies. ” Jerusalem Post: “Israelis protest Trump travel ban, citing history of Jewish refugees. ” I24 News: “Protesters ‘fight back’ against US, Israel’s refugee and immigration policies. ” Times of Israel: “At Tel Aviv protest, activists hear echoes of Israeli policy in Trump’s refugee ban. ” The L. A. Times article was also picked up by Yahoo! News. Despite the headlines, the articles themselves could not hide the small size of the protest, prompting questions as to why the news media would find the gathering newsworthy in the first place. The L. A. Times conceded the crowd consisted of “several dozen demonstrators. ” The Times of Israel put the number at “some 40 protesters. ”  The Jerusalem Post also cited about forty demonstrators. The turnout is particularly disappointing for Tel Aviv, a city known for its ability to mobilize massive numbers of   protesters. Trump’s executive order halts visas for 90 days for “immigrants and  ” from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Iran, and Iraq. The order further suspended the entry of all refugees for 120 days, indefinitely blocked Syrian refugees from entering and lowered the ceiling to 50, 000 for refugees allowed to enter the U. S. during Fiscal Year 2017. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

10366,29102,Five Anti-Israel Offenses In Paris ‘Peace’ Summit Final Declaration - Breitbart,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,1/15/2017,2017,1,,"TEL AVIV  —   Instead of convening a summit on the ongoing civil war in Syria, or the migrant crisis threatening Europe, or the rampant   plaguing its own country, France on Sunday held a convention attended by over 70 nations to affirm the international community’s commitment to creating a Palestinian state. [At the end of the farcical display, and with neither Israel nor the Palestinian Authority in attendance, the Paris summit representatives released a brief concluding declaration unanimously agreed to after negotiations between the countries.  Reports here credited Israeli diplomats with helping to water down the   language of the final declaration, calling the text a “significant weakening” and “less harsh than was initially expected. ” Still, the text was anything but fair. Here are five   offenses in the   final declaration: 1  —   The text draws a moral equivalency between “violence,” which would include Palestinian terrorism targeting civilians, and “settlement activity,” meaning Israelis building homes in the West Bank or eastern sections of Jerusalem. The text states: They emphasized the importance for the parties to restate their commitment to this solution, to take urgent steps in order to reverse the current negative trends on the ground, including continued acts of violence and ongoing settlement activity, and to start meaningful direct negotiations. 2  —   The declaration calls for Israel to “fully end the occupation that began in 1967,” language that seems to mean that Israel would need to withdraw from the entire West Bank and eastern Jerusalem and thus shrink the country to indefensible borders. Those are the territories that Israel captured in the defensive war of 1967.  Withdrawing “fully” would seem to imply that Israel should evacuate those territories in their entirety. Some of the holiest sites in Judaism are located in eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank, including the Western Wall and Temple Mount in Jerusalem’s Old City the Cave of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs in Hebron, which was home to the oldest continuous Jewish community in the world until the Jews of Hebron were massacred and expelled the Tomb of Rachel in Bethlehem and Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus  —   biblical Shechem. The diplomats who convened in Paris, however, seem unaware of the text of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, which today’s declaration affirms as the basis of a future   deal. After stating that Israel should “fully end the occupation that began in 1967,” the Paris declaration then references Resolution 242. The declaration states: They reiterated that a negotiated   solution should meet the legitimate aspirations of both sides, including the Palestinians’ right to statehood and sovereignty, fully end the occupation that began in 1967, satisfy Israel’s security needs and resolve all permanent status issues on the basis of United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and also recalled relevant Security Council resolutions. Resolution 242 calls on Israel to withdraw under a future   solution “from territories occupied” as a result of the 1967 Six Day War. The resolution does not call for a withdrawal from “all territories,” a designation deliberately left out to ensure Israel’s ability to retain some territory for security purposes under a future deal. The Jewish Virtual Library explains: The Security Council did not say Israel must withdraw from “all the” territories occupied after the   War. This was quite deliberate. The Soviet delegate wanted the inclusion of those words and said that their exclusion meant “that part of these territories can remain in Israeli hands. ” The Arab states pushed for the word “all” to be included, but this was rejected. They nevertheless asserted that they would read the resolution as if it included the word “all. ” The British ambassador who drafted the approved resolution, Lord Caradon, declared after the vote: “It is only the resolution that will bind us, and we regard its wording as clear. ” 3  —    The declaration patronizes Israel by calling on both parties to “restate” their commitments to the   solution. Only one side has not been committed to peace. Israel has offered the Palestinians a state in much of the West Bank and Gaza Strip with a shared capital in Jerusalem numerous times. These offers were made at Camp David in 2000, Taba in 2001, the Annapolis Conference in 2007, and more offers were made in 2008. In each of these cases, the PA refused generous Israeli offers of statehood and bolted negotiations without counteroffers. The PA has failed to respond to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s unprecedented attempts to   negotiations aimed at creating a Palestinian state, including freezing Jewish construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem and releasing Palestinian prisoners. 4  —   The declaration gives credibility to the   Arab Peace Initiative, which threatens Israel’s security. The declaration states: “They underscored the importance of the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 as a comprehensive framework for the resolution of the   conflict, thus contributing to regional peace and security,” states today’s declaration. This reporter previously exposed the Saudi “peace” initiative: The Saudi Initiative, originally proposed by Saudi Arabia in 2002, states that Israel would receive “normal relations” with the Arab world in exchange for a full withdrawal from the entire Gaza Strip, West Bank, Golan Heights and eastern Jerusalem, which includes the Temple Mount.   …     The Saudi plan also demands the imposition of a   U. N. resolution that calls for   Palestinian refugees who wish to move inside Israel to be permitted to do so at the “earliest practicable date. ” Palestinians have long demanded the “right of return” for millions of “refugees,” a formula Israeli officials across the political spectrum warn is code for Israel’s destruction by flooding the Jewish state with millions of Arabs, thereby changing its demographics. When Arab countries attacked the Jewish state after its creation in 1948, some 725, 000 Arabs living within Israel’s borders fled or were expelled from the area that became Israel. Also at that time, about 820, 000 Jews were expelled from Arab countries or fled following rampant persecution. While most Jewish refugees were absorbed by Israel and other countries, the majority of Palestinian Arabs have been maintained in 59 U. N.  camps that do not seek to settle its inhabitants elsewhere. There are currently about four million Arabs who claim Palestinian refugee status with the U. N. including children and grandchildren of the original fleeing Arabs Arabs living   in Jordan and Arabs who long ago emigrated throughout the Middle East and to the West. According to Arab sources close to the Saudi Initiative, Arab countries are willing to come to an agreement whereby Israel absorbs about 500, 000 “refugees” and reaches a compensation deal with the PA for the remaining millions of Palestinians. 5  —   The Paris declaration “welcomed” UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which passed last month when the U. S. abstained and refers to the entire West Bank and eastern Jerusalem as   occupied Palestinian territories while demanding a complete halt to all Israeli construction in those areas.

10391,29127,Al Aqsa Mufti: U.S. Embassy Jerusalem Move An ’Assault’ on Muslims,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,1/13/2017,2017,1,,"Jerusalem’s Grand Mufti (pictured) Muhammad Ahmad Hussein on Friday claimed that   Donald Trump’s reported plans to relocated the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem represented an “assault” on Muslims worldwide. [Hussein, who preaches at the Al Aqsa Mosque, was appointed to his position by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.    mosques routinely utilize Friday afternoon prayers to incite against Israel.  “The pledge to move the embassy is not just an assault against Palestinians but against Arabs and Muslims, who will not remain silent,” Hussein said in his sermon. “The transfer of the embassy violates international charters and norms which recognize Jerusalem as an occupied city,” Hussein claimed, without mentioning Trump by name. Hussein seems to be fulfilling a pledge by Palestinian leaders who called earlier this week for Friday prayers to be used to protest reports that Trump may move the embassy to Jerusalem. Earlier todayit was reported that Abbas this month met with American businessmen who allegedly told him Trump was serious about moving the embassy to Jerusalem. The Palestinians claim eastern Jerusalem as their future capital.  Last month, a U. S. abstention allowed the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution calling the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem “occupied Palestinian territories,” and demanding a halt to Israeli construction in those areas.

10634,29370,Obama Vs. Trump: Ex-President Returns to Radical Community Organizing to Save His Tattered Legacy - Breitbart,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,3/14/2017,2017,3,,"As President Donald Trump plans a slew of policies that could dismantle key parts of Barack Obama’s presidential legacy, the former president seems to be returning to his roots as a Saul   radical community organizer. [This time Obama and his associates’ objective is to stop Trump’s domestic and foreign policy agendas on virtually all fronts  —   immigration reform, border security, the roll back of the controversial Obamacare system and more.  According to some accounts, Obama and his associates may be seeking no less than Trump’s impeachment.  The strategies for disruption seem to include everything from nonprofit   activism and the filing of legal motions to support for protest movements targeting Trump and top administration officials. This as Trump works to secure America’s porous borders, fix the faltering economy, replace Obama’s largely failed healthcare law, combat the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism, contend with the threat of Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, and address the issue of illegal immigration that was put on steroids during Obama’s two terms in office. The latest sign of Obama’s fingerprints on Trump disruption plots comes from reports on Monday that former Obama administration staffers have formed a group to closely monitor the Trump administration. FoxNews. com reported: Known as American Oversight, the group will search for anything that seems amiss, whether it touches on ethics or fraud, among other potential problems, the group’s executive director, Austin Evers, told Fox News. “We are conducting oversight because Congress won’t,” said Evers, who was a State Department lawyer in the Obama administration. “We are using tools available to American citizens to investigate instances of fraud, corruption, violation of ethics rules, you name it. If there’s something that Congress should be investigating, we will be. ” Earlier this month, the Daily Mail reported that Obama’s top adviser, Valerie Jarrett, has moved into Obama’s   dollar rental home in the nation’s capital. The newspaper claimed Obama is turning his home “into the nerve center of the mounting insurgency against” Trump. “Obama’s goal, according to a close family friend, is to oust Trump from the presidency either by forcing his resignation or through his impeachment,” reported the Daily Mail. Evidence of Obama’s close associations with efforts to oppose Trump emerged two weeks ago when a group of former top lawyers for the Obama administration formed their own organization aimed at utilizing legal advocacy methods to target Trump’s policies. That organization is calling itself United to Protect Democracy, drawing on the theme of Obama’s farewell speech last month. The legal activist group is already partnered with an organization heavily financed by billionaire George Soros and is led by a former Obama lawyer who previously worked at a   global activist outfit, this reporter documented. Then there is also evidence of   support for protests targeting Trump. Last month, it was reported that Organizing for Action, the activist group that emerged from Obama’s first presidential campaign, has partnered with the   Indivisible Project for “online trainings” on how to protest Trump’s agenda. One week earlier, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by billionaire George Soros. Organizing for Action (OFA) is a   community organizing project that sprung from Obama’s 2012 campaign organization, Organizing for America, becoming a nonprofit described by the Washington Post as “advocat[ing] for the president’s policies. ” Last month, NBC News reported on OFA’s new actions and its partnership with Indivisible: OFA has hired 14 field organizers in states home to key senators as part of its campaign to defend Obama’s signature healthcare law. To run that campaign, the group hired Saumya Narechania  —   the former national field director at Enroll America, which worked to sign people up for Obamacare  —   and a deputy campaign manager.   …     OFA says more than 1, 800 people have applied to its Spring Community Engagement Fellowship, a   training program,   of whom have not previously been involved with OFA. And the group has teamed up with Indivisible, a buzzy newcomer to the progressive movement, to offer organizing training that began Thursday night with a video conference. A combined 25, 000 people have registered to participate in those trainings, OFA said. Writing at the New York Post, researcher and reporter Paul Sperry charged that Obama “is intimately involved in OFA operations and even tweets from the group’s account. In fact, he gave marching orders to OFA foot soldiers following Trump’s upset victory. ” Sperry was referring to comments Obama reportedly made in a November conference call with   grassroots supporters, telling them “Now is the time for some organizing. ” Obama hinted he will return to community organizing, stating: “I promise you that next year Michelle and I are going to be right there with you, and the clouds are going to start parting and the sun is going to come back out, and we’re going to be busy, involved in the amazing stuff that we’ve been doing all these years before. ” Perry further reported on OFA: In what’s shaping up to be a highly unusual   Obama isn’t just staying behind in Washington. He’s working behind the scenes to set up what will effectively be a shadow government to not only protect his threatened legacy, but to sabotage the incoming administration and its popular “America First” agenda. He’s doing it through a network of leftist nonprofits led by Organizing for Action. Normally you’d expect an organization set up to support a politician and his agenda to close up shop after that candidate leaves office, but not Obama’s OFA. Rather, it’s gearing up for battle, with a growing war chest and more than 250 offices across the country. Meanwhile, Politico recently profiled the   Indivisible, reporting the group has been aided by MoveOn. org and the ACLU. The associations between the   Indivisible and the   MoveOn. org and ACLU may be telling since the latter two groups have been central to recent efforts to stop Trump. Two weeks ago, within hours of reports surfacing that Attorney General Jeff Sessions held two conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U. S. while he was Alabama’s senator and served on the Armed Services Committee, MoveOn. org was already outside the U. S. Department of Justice building calling for Sessions’ resignation. Sessions maintains that the conversations did not concern the 2016 presidential campaign.  He served as an informal adviser to Trump during the presidential race. MoveOn. org and Indivisible are also planning what the groups claim will be a massive   Tax March in Washington and at least 60 other locations on April 15. Meanwhile, lawyers from the ACLU and other groups financed by Soros were signatories to a lawsuit filed to block Trump’s original refugee order. In response to the lawsuit, U. S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued an emergency order that temporarily blocked U. S. authorities from deporting travelers from the nations listed in Trump’s executive order. Obama’s newfound activism seems to bring him back to his early days in the 1980s as an   community organizer working in the South Side of Chicago. As a reporter at WND. com, this journalist previously extensively documented Obama’s ties to Alinsky ideology. Here are a few samples: The executive director of an activist organization that taught Alinsky’s tactics of direct action, confrontation and intimidation was part of the team that developed volunteers for President Obama’s 2008 campaign. Jackie Kendall, executive director of the Midwest Academy, was on the team that developed Camp Obama, a    day intensive course run in conjunction with Obama’s campaign. It trained volunteers to become activists to help Obama win the presidential election. WND also reported the Woods Fund, a nonprofit for which Obama served as a paid board director from 1999 to December 2002, provided capital to the Midwest Academy. Obama sat on the Woods Fund board alongside William Ayers, founder of the Weather Underground domestic terrorist organization. Also, in 1998, Obama participated in a panel discussion praising Alinsky alongside Midwest Academy’s founder Heather Booth, an organizer and dedicated disciple of Alinsky. The panel discussion following the opening performance in Chicago of the play “The Love Song of Saul Alinsky,” a work described by the Chicago   as “bringing to life one of America’s greatest community organizers. ” Obama participated in the discussion alongside other Alinskyites, including Booth, political analyst Aaron Freeman, Don Turner of the Chicago Federation of Labor and Northwestern University history professor Charles Paine. Perhaps tellingly, Alinsky’s son, L. David Alinsky, praised Obama in August 2008 for his showing at the Democratic National Convention, which had the “elements of the perfectly organized event, Saul Alinsky style,” according to the son. David Alinsky wrote: Barack Obama’s training in Chicago by the great community organizers is showing its effectiveness. It is an amazingly powerful format, and the method of my late father always works to get the message out and get the supporters on board. When executed meticulously and thoughtfully, it is a powerful strategy for initiating change and making it really happen. Obama learned his lesson well. I am proud to see that my father’s model for organizing is being applied successfully beyond local community organizing to affect the Democratic campaign in 2008. It is a fine tribute to Saul Alinsky as we approach his 100th birthday. David Horowitz, founder of the David Horowitz Freedom Center and a former 1960’s radical, considers Alinsky to be the “    who helped establish the dual political tactics of confrontation and infiltration that characterized the 1960s and have remained central to all subsequent revolutionary movements in the United States. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

10653,29389,Alarming Rise in Palestinian Attacks Since UN Anti-Israel Resolution - Breitbart,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,1/10/2017,2017,1,,"TEL AVIV  —   Israeli defense officials here have noted a sharp increase in Palestinian   attacks since the United Nations Security Council passed an   resolution on December 23, 2016 calling the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem “occupied Palestinian territories. ”[Avi Issacharoff at the Times of Israel notes:  In September 346   attacks were recorded, in October 375, in November 420, and in December 344. Most of the December attacks occurred in the final week of the month. In the first week of January there were 169 recorded attacks, a pace that, if maintained, would lead to almost 700 attacks by the end of the month. Issacharoff writes that the increase in rock attacks could be linked to exam season in Palestinian high schools, although a similar increase was not recorded in previous years. There are several other factors that could be at play, he writes: The rock attacks were also linked to a series of anniversaries taking place around now, including that of Fatah’s founding and first terrorist attack on January 1, 1965, and of the assassination of Yahya Ayyash, Hamas’s chief bomb maker, on January 5, 1996. However, one cannot ignore the possible linkage to the UN Security Council resolution last month and Secretary of State John Kerry’s Mideast speech two weeks ago criticizing Israeli construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem.  The uptick in attacks also comes one week before the Palestinians are scheduled to attend a farcical Paris “peace” conference at which the international community, minus Israel, is slated to get together to set the future parameters of a Palestinian state. Some of the holiest sites in Judaism are located in eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank, including the Western Wall and Temple Mount in Jerusalem’s Old City the Cave of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs in Hebron, which was home to the oldest continuous Jewish community in the world until the Jews of Hebron were massacred and expelled the Tomb of Rachel in Bethlehem and Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus  —   biblical Shechem. I raised questions about the possible motivation for the deadly   terrorist attack in Jerusalem on Monday. The attack, which killed four and wounded 17, was carried out in the eastern Jerusalem neighborhood of Armon Hanatziv, also known as East Talpiot, just after the UN and Kerry singled out Israeli construction in eastern Jerusalem. The Palestinians have a long and sordid history of responding to peace talks or international pressure on Israel with a terror campaign targeting Israelis. Arch terrorist Yasser Arafat personified that tactic when he responded to generous Israeli statehood offers in September 2000 by launching the deadly Second Intifada instead of accepting a Palestinian state or even making a  .  That intifada was kicked off with   attacks before it morphed into a   terrorist onslaught of shootings and suicide bombings. Within less than 48 hours of last month’s   UN resolution, there was an immediate surge in Palestinian terrorist attacks targeting Jews in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem. While it is still too early to evaluate, the spike in rock throwing attacks and other Palestinian terrorist incidents may be indicative of an alarming trend that could lead to the one word Israeli defense officials try to avoid using in their predictions: intifada.

10659,29395,Flashback – Report: Obama Administration ‘Shut Down’ Comey Request on Russia Probe,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,5/18/2017,2017,5,,"Amid a New York Times report  —   denied by the White House  —   that President Trump tried during a private meeting to convince   Director Comey to drop an investigation into fired national security adviser Michael Flynn, it may be instructive to recall reports of Obama administration officials allegedly meddling in Comey’s FBI affairs. [In one case, White House officials, according to one source speaking to the news media, reportedly “shut it down,” referring to a request by Comey to go public with FBI information regarding alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.  The reports come despite Obama administration attempts to portray Comey’s role as head of the FBI as independent of any influence from the executive branch. Indeed, when Obama first met with Comey to discuss the possibility of appointing him to lead the FBI, a source with knowledge of the meeting told CNN that the president made it a point not to meet with Comey    again for fear of creating the appearance of influence. “This was (Obama’s) policy with the FBI director and with judicial appointees,” the source said to CNN. “He felt the White House should have a clear separation from the FBI about ongoing investigations  —   there should never be any intimation that the President or the White House staff was leaning in and trying to influence live investigations by the FBI,” the source said. Fast forward to March, when Newsweek reported that Comey wanted to first go public as early as the summer of 2016 about the agency’s information on alleged Russian interference in the presidential campaign. However, Obama administration officials blocked Comey from making public statements, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter speaking to Newsweek. “The White House shut it down,” one source told the magazine, explaining that Comey had pitched the idea of writing an oped about the subject during a White House Situation Room meeting in June or July. “He had a draft of it or an outline. He held up a piece of paper in a meeting and said, ‘I want to go forward. What do people think of this? ’” the source said.  The source told Newsweek the meeting was attended by Secretary of State John Kerry, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and National Security Adviser Susan Rice. Continued the report: But many in the room didn’t like the idea, and White House officials thought the announcement should be a coordinated message backed by multiple agencies, the source says. “An   doesn’t have the same stature. It comes from one person. ” This is not the only time a member of the Obama administration reportedly influenced a decision by Comey. According to an extensive report in the New York Times, Attorney General Lynch, an Obama appointee, convinced Comey to use the word “matter” instead of “investigation” when the FBI director publicly addressed the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. This despite the Justice Department knowing the FBI probe was not only an official investigation but a criminal investigation. Comey reportedly caved in and called the investigation a “matter” even though, according to the Times, Comey was aware of the existence of a document written by a Democratic operative that allegedly indicated Lynch would have protected Clinton in the email probe.  The newspaper reported that “Mr. Comey believed (Lynch) had subtly helped play down the Clinton investigation. ” The Times reported on a meeting between FBI and Justice officials at which, according to the newspaper’s characterization, “Lynch told him (Comey) to be even more circumspect: Do not even call it an investigation, she said, according to three people who attended the meeting. Call it a ‘matter. ’” Continued the Times’ report: Ms. Lynch reasoned that the word “investigation” would raise other questions: What charges were being investigated? Who was the target? But most important, she believed that the department should stick by its policy of not confirming investigations. It was a    decision. But Mr. Comey and other F. B. I. officials regarded it as disingenuous in an investigation that was so widely known. And Mr. Comey was concerned that a Democratic attorney general was asking him to be misleading and line up his talking points with Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, according to people who spoke with him afterward. As the meeting broke up, George Z. Toscas, a national security prosecutor, ribbed Mr. Comey. “I guess you’re the Federal Bureau of Matters now,” Mr. Toscas said, according to two people who were there. Even though Comey reportedly had concerns about Lynch’s motivations, he went along and did not call the criminal investigation an investigation. “I am confident we have the resources and the personnel assigned to the matter,” Comey stated mere days after the meeting with Lynch.

10863,29599,"PICTURES – Trump Visits Western Wall, Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem - Breitbart",Breitbart,Aaron Klein,5/22/2017,2017,5,,"JERUSALEM  —   President Donald Trump on Monday visited the Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem as part of his   tour here in Israel. [The church, believed to be the place of Jesus’s crucifixion, burial and resurrection, is one of the holiest sites in Christianity. Trump met outside the church with leaders of local Christian denominations before going inside for a private tour closed to the news media.  Afterwards, Trump went to the nearby Western Wall where he became the first sitting U. S. president to visit the Jewish holy site. The Western Wall is part of an ancient retaining wall erected around the Jewish Temple.  The Temple Mount, site of the first and second Jewish Temples, is considered the holiest site in Judaism.        Trump toured the holy sites after a red carpet ceremony at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv and a meeting with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin at the president’s residence in Jerusalem. Trump is headed next to a private social dinner with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On Tuesday, Trump’s schedule includes a meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem and then a   ceremony at Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.  Trump will then give a speech at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem before departing the country for the Vatican. Trump is here in Jerusalem on Jerusalem Day, a national holiday that marks Israel’s reunification of Jerusalem after the 1967 Six Day War and the establishment of Israeli sovereignty over the eastern sections of the city, which include the Old City, Western Wall and Temple Mount. Many will be watching to see if Trump uses the visit to announce that he is moving the U. S. embassy from the beach in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, although reports put that as unlikely. Israel officially annexed Jerusalem in 1980 in a move not recognized by the international community because the Palestinians claim eastern sections of the city for a future Palestinian capital despite their never having had a state or entity in those areas. Current U. S. law does not officially recognize Israeli control over the eastern sections of the city, going so far as to prevent American citizens born in Jerusalem from listing “Israel” as their country of birth. All eyes will be on Trump to see if he makes any declarations regarding Israel’s status in Jerusalem. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

10952,29688,KLEIN - Iran Is the Wild Card Following U.S. Air Strikes In Syria,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,4/7/2017,2017,4,,"TEL AVIV  —   Following the U. S. launch of Tomahawk missiles targeting a strategic Syrian airfield on Thursday night, Iran must be monitored carefully for the possibility that it may use its proxies for retaliation, especially against Israel’s northern border. [Following eight years of inaction on Syria under the Obama administration, President Donald Trump demonstrated last night that he is willing to hold Syrian President Bashar   to account, this time by striking the Shayrat Airfield near the Syrian city of Homs that was believed to have been utilized to carry out a chemical weapons attack that killed scores of civilians.  The U. S. airstrikes signaled to Assad and his Russian and Iranian backers that Trump will act in Syria and the administration strongly supports the removal of the Syrian president  —   an important strategic ally of Moscow and Tehran. The U. S. military move demonstrates to Israel and the Sunni Arab bloc cast aside by Obama’s nuclear deal with the mullahs that American leadership has officially returned to the region. Assad himself is unlikely to retaliate since the last thing he wants amidst a   insurgency attempting to topple his regime is to go to war with Trump or expand the battlefield to U. S. ally Israel. Trump’s bold authority in Syria directly threatens Russian interests since it was Moscow that largely filled the security vacuum in that country when Obama repeatedly failed to take any meaningful action against Assad. However, Russia’s direct response will most likely be confined to vocal protestation, such as Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling the U. S. strikes “aggression against a sovereign nation” carried out on a “  pretext. ” President Vladimir Putin cannot risk a military confrontation with Trump and Russia is already signaling willingness to abandon Assad to come to a larger regional accommodation. Still, there is the possibility that Russia may quietly support action by others, especially agents of a very nervous Iranian regime that has been preparing proxies for years who can heat up Israel’s northern border and beyond.  Both Moscow and Tehran have reason for wanting Trump to pay a price for acting in their Syrian playground.  The question is whether they will dare to respond, even tacitly. And that brings us to Iran.  Trump’s embrace of America’s traditional Sunni Arab partners at the expense of Tehran and his strong positions against the disastrous international nuclear agreement have been deeply concerning to the expansionist,   Twelvers in Tehran.  And while the removal of Assad from power would be a blow to Russia, depending on the ultimate outcome such a move could be disastrous for Iran’s position in Syria.  Iranian Revolutionary Guard units have been fighting the   insurgents alongside the Syrian military and the   Hezbollah militia.  Syria represents a key pawn in Iran’s geopolitical chessboard that stretches across the vital region. In recent weeks, there have been strong indications that Iran has been seeking to arm its Hezbollah proxy with even more advanced weapons that can target the Jewish state. Last month, Israel took the unusual step of striking a Hezbollah weapons convoy near the city of Palmyra that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was transporting advanced weapons to the   militia. Israeli leaders and Hezbollah terrorists have in recent weeks ratcheted up war rhetoric, with Israeli officials warning that Hezbollah, which can only act at the direction of Iran, has been preparing for conflict. Last Sunday, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot warned the IDF would not hold back from striking Lebanese state institutions in a future conflict with Hezbollah. “The recent declarations from Beirut make it clear that in a future war, the targets will be clear: Lebanon and the organizations operating under its authority and its approval,” Eisenkot stated. Hezbollah is not Iran’s only option. Breitbart Jerusalem has been reporting on the formation of a “Golan Liberation Brigade,” which was announced last month by the   of the Iraqi Harakat al Nujaba Shiite militia and is reportedly being trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.  The   militia is another Iranian front that could be used to target Israel’s Golan Heights at the behest of Tehran. The next few days and weeks will be critical in determining Iran and Russia’s resolve in the face of an awakened America that has returned from its   slumber.

10958,29694,Georgia Candidate Jon Ossoff’s Film Firm Financed by Facebook Fact Check Funder,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,4/19/2017,2017,4,,"Democrat Jon Ossoff, the candidate who fell short of the   mark needed to capture a House seat in an Atlanta district that has long been a Republican stronghold, serves as the CEO of an investigative film company that has received backing from the   Omidyar Network. [The Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit for liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, has partnered with George Soros’s Open Society on numerous projects and has given grants to third parties using the   Tides Foundation. Tides is one of the largest donors to   causes in the U. S.  The Omidyar Network is also a prominent donor to the International   Network, the project of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies that is helping Facebook to determine whether a certain story is “disputed. ” Poynter’s IFCN is also funded by Soros’ Open Society Foundations, as well as by the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, Google, and the National Endowment for Democracy. In March, the Omidyar Network also provided the   League (ADL) whose chief has baselessly smeared Breitbart News with claims of   associations, with a   seed donation to build a Silicon Valley command center purportedly aimed at combating online hate. Ossoff serves as managing director and CEO of the   Insight TWI (The World Investigates) which describes itself as producing “  documentary films and television programmes, specializing in fresh, daring factual content and   journalism. ” Continues a company description: “Insight’s   Peabody, and BAFTA   team has decades of experience working safely in   environments and a focus on immersive storytelling that makes the important interesting. ” The company’s leaders produced “Blood on the Stone,” a documentary that accompanied the DVD for the   “Blood Diamond” movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Insight TWI collaborated with with Al Jazeera English to produce an “Africa Investigates” series. In 2014, the Omidyar Network provided Ossoff’s Insight TWI with a $350, 000 investment, listing Ossoff specifically on the award announcement posted on Omidyar’s website. Regarding the Facebook   project, the   International   Network recently drafted a code of five principles for news websites to accept, and Facebook announced it will work with “  fact checking organizations” that are signatories to the code of principles. Facebook says that if the “fact checking organizations” determine that a certain story is fake, it will get flagged as disputed and, according to the Facebook announcement, “there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed. ” Omidyar also provided the seed capital for the ADL’s new Silicon Valley command center reportedly aimed at combatting online hate. According to the ADL’s press release announcing the Omidyar grant, the ADL will work with tech sector leaders to look into   options for reducing “online harassment,” including “artificial intelligence, big data,   reality, and other technologies. ” Ossoff, a former aide to Rep. Hank Johnson ( ) was widely touted by major progressive groups for his attempt to win a House race in Atlanta’s conservative suburbs. The Democratic Party excitement surrounding Ossoff’s bid led the Drudge Report to label him the “Dem Trump slayer” in a banner headline. Drudge later mockingly crossed out the words “Dem Trump slayer” as Ossoff’s chances for victory seemed to have faded. The Washington Post reported on the latest results of Ossoff’s bid: Unofficial returns showed that Ossoff had earned less than 50 percent of the vote, the threshold needed to declare an outright victory. Instead, with 48. 3 percent, Ossoff was headed to a runoff against Republican Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state and the top GOP   in a special election to replace Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District. In a statement early Wednesday, Ossoff acknowledged that he had fallen short: “This is already a remarkable victory,” he said. “We defied the odds, shattered expectations, and now are ready to fight on and win in June. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

11010,29746,"FLASHBACK - Reports: Obama’s 2008 Campaign Reps Talked with Iran, Hamas",Breitbart,Aaron Klein,2/15/2017,2017,2,,"Amid the controversy surrounding White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s alleged conversations with Russia, it may be instrumental to recall that representatives for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign were accused of meeting with Hamas and Iran. [Depending on what took place, the alleged contacts with Iran may have violated the Logan Act, which bars citizens from negotiating with foreign governments in dispute with the United States. It may be questionable whether Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, legally qualifies as a foreign government.  In 2008, Robert Malley stepped down as an informal foreign policy adviser to Obama’s campaign when it was revealed that he met with Hamas members. Malley admitted to the meetings, but he claimed he met with the terrorists as part of his private job. “I have never hidden the fact that I had meetings with Hamas,” Malley wrote in an open letter published in the New York Times. “I do this as part of my job as Middle East program director at the International Crisis Group. ” He said he distanced himself from Obama’s campaign because the Hamas meetings were “becoming a distraction to me and to Senator Obama’s campaign, and to avoid any misperception  —   misrepresentation being the more accurate word  —   about the candidate’s position regarding the Islamist movement. ” Malley later joined the Obama administration. In 2015, he was appointed to lead the Middle East desk of the National Security Council. He was also named Obama’s special adviser regarding the Islamic State. Meanwhile, in August 2014, Michael Ledeen, a former consultant to the National Security Council and U. S. Defense Department, penned a column at PJ Media stating Obama opened a   to Iran during the 2008 presidential campaign. Ledeen said the back channel went through retired Ambassador William G. Miller, who also led the 1979 negotiating mission during the Iran hostage crisis. Ladeen wrote that Miller confirmed his   involvement to him. Ledeen wrote: The actual strategy is detente first, and then a full alliance with Iran throughout the Middle East and North Africa. It has been on display since before the beginning of the Obama administration. During his first presidential campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama used a secret back channel to Tehran to assure the mullahs that he was a friend of the Islamic Republic, and that they would be very happy with his policies. The secret channel was Ambassador William G. Miller, who served in Iran during the shah’s rule, as chief of staff for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and as ambassador to Ukraine. Ambassador Miller has confirmed to me his conversations with Iranian leaders during the 2008 campaign. The Logan Act states: Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.

11094,29830,EXCLUSIVE – Carter Page Requests Release of FISA Warrant Details ‘Concocted’ by James Comey’s FBI - Breitbart,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,6/12/2017,2017,6,,"PHILADELPHIA  —   Carter Page, the American financial consultant who was tangentially and briefly associated with Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, on Monday sent a request to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein seeking the release of information used to reportedly obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) warrant to monitor his personal communications. [Page sent the inquiry in an email to Rosenstein shared exclusively with Breitbart News.  The FISA information release request was sent ahead of Tuesday’s scheduled Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing with Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Page wrote: Whereas this will be an open hearing (with Sessions) I would kindly request the immediate prior release of my illegitimate 2016 FISA warrants which were allegedly concocted by the FBI on Mr. Comey’s watch.   …    I know that your team at the DoJ is currently working on my related request for these documents.  However, the highly   nature of tomorrow’s SSCI hearing would offer essential context for these discussions before Congress.   …    I think the “really important documents” you could release would show a great deal about the nature of not just Comey and his continued lies, but the exceptionally dishonest nature of the Clinton campaign and Obama Administration on whose behalf he was acting.  Thank you in advance for your consideration. On April 11, the Washington Post cited “law enforcement and other U. S. officials” stating that, as part of its investigation into alleged Russian collusion, the FBI obtained a secret FISA court order last summer to monitor Page’s communications. The Post acknowledged it was reporting on leaked information, highlighting that the officials “spoke about the court order on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of a counterintelligence probe. ” The Post further reported on the court order: The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Page’s communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to the officials. The newspaper allowed that Page had not been accused of any crimes. It reported that the FISA court renewed the   warrant on Page more than once, according to the officials. The U. S. government has not responded to a Freedom of Information Act request from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) seeking information on why Page was surveilled. In April, CNN reported that the controversial   dossier on Trump compiled by a former British intelligence officer served as part of the FBI’s justification for seeking the FISA court’s approval to clandestinely monitor Page. In his testimony last month before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on FBI oversight,   Director James B. Comey repeatedly refused to answer questions about his agency’s ties to the dossier, including whether it was used in the Russia probe. In subsequent testimony last week, Comey admitted that he pushed back against a request from Trump to possibly investigate the origins of “salacious material” that the agency possessed in the course of its investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. The “salacious material” is clearly a reference to claims made inside the controversial dossier. The partially discredited dossier contains wild and unproven claims that the Russians had information on Trump and sordid sexual acts, including the mocked claim that Trump hired prostitutes and had them urinate on a hotel room bed. The document was authored by former intelligence agent Christopher Steele, who was reportedly paid by Democrats and   Republicans to investigate Trump. In April, Steele conceded in court documents that part of his work still needed to be verified. The Steele document, which Page refers to as the “Dodgy Dossier,” makes the unsubstantiated claim that Page met with Russian officials as an envoy for the Trump campaign to discuss policy issues and topics related to alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Page has steadfastly denied meeting any of the officials mentioned in Steele’s dossier and he says he never served as an envoy for the Trump campaign. Page and campaign, Page’s role in Trump’s presidential campaign has long been seemingly exaggerated in the news media. In an interview with the Post’s editorial board last March, Trump briefly mentioned Page as a member of his foreign policy advisory team. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks clarified that Page’s role was “informal. ” Page has been cited in various news media reports as an “  policy adviser” to Trump’s campaign and a “Trump associate. ” An article in the New Yorker recently claimed he was a member of Trump’s “inner circle. ” In the letter to the House Intelligence Committee last month, Page states that he never met Trump and that he was an “informal, unpaid campaign volunteer” and a “very junior member of the Trump movement who didn’t actually have any direct    discussions or meetings with our candidate. ” Page charges that the news media has been inflating his relationship with Trump’s presidential campaign in an effort to tarnish the U. S. president. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

11109,29845,Donald Trump Rips Media for ’Wrong’ Russia Meeting Report: ’Never Mentioned the Word Israel’,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,5/22/2017,2017,5,,"JERUSALEM  —   President Donald Trump on Monday told reporters here that he “never mentioned” Israel during a White House meeting two weeks ago with Russian officials. [He went on to accuse the news media of getting the story wrong.  Trump was referring to a news making New York Times report quoting a “current and a former American official” claiming it was Israel that provided alleged classified intelligence purportedly disclosed by Trump to Russian officials during the recent meeting.  “Just so you understand, I never mentioned the word or the name ‘Israel,’” Trump told reporters here after making brief statements with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “Never mentioned it during the conversation [with the Russians]. ” “They’re all saying I did, so you have another story wrong,” he said to the assembled reporters. “Never mentioned the word Israel. ” Trump was speaking spontaneously after reporters shouted questions at him at the conclusion of a joint statement with Netanyahu.  The Israeli prime minister referred to U. S.  security cooperation as “terrific. ” The Times report did not claim that Trump disclosed to the Russians that Israel was allegedly the source of the information purported to be about the inner workings of the Islamic State as reportedly discussed with the Russians. The Times’ claim followed a Washington Post exclusive that first reported the purported classified information was allegedly revealed by Trump during a meeting with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador.  The Post report cited “current and former U. S. officials. ” Indeed, it was the Times that first outed Israel as the alleged source of the information. The Times’ article failed to note its own report, if accurate, could endanger Israel’s antiterrorism intelligence collection operations. The Post article acknowledged that as president “Trump has broad authority to declassify government secrets, making it unlikely that his disclosures broke the law. ” The Times cited Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser, as telling reporters that Trump was not aware of the source of the information. Israeli officials reached by the Times would not confirm that Israel provided the intelligence, which reportedly concerns the inner workings of the Islamic State. McMaster told the Post that “the president and the foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation. ” “At no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed, and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly,” McMaster stated. Later, McMaster stated the leak may put U. S. national security at risk. “I think national security is put at risk by this leak and by leaks like this,” he said. “And there are a number of instances where this has occurred and I think it’s important to investigate these sort of things. ” Trump tweeted he has the “absolute right” as president to share information. As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W. H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining  …    .  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017,  The Post claimed the information was provided through an unnamed U. S. ally: The information the president relayed had been provided by a U. S. partner through an   arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U. S. government, officials said. The partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia, and officials said Trump’s decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State. The Times outed that ally as Israel, citing a “current and a former American official familiar with how the United States obtained the information. ” In January, Israel’s respected Yediot Ahronot newspaper reported U. S. intelligence officials from the Obama administration warned their Israeli counterparts not to trust then   Trump with intelligence secrets, citing alleged fears that Russia held blackmail information over Trump.  Those fears seemed to have been in part referencing the now partially debunked infamous dossier claiming that Russia collected compromising videos of Trump. The dossier, which contains wild and unproven claims about Trump and sordid sexual acts, including the mocked claim that Trump hired prostitutes and had them urinate on a hotel room bed, was compiled by former intelligence agent Christopher Steele, who was reportedly paid by Democrats and   Republicans to investigate Trump. Meanwhile, the Obama administration faced its share of accusations that it leaked sensitive Israeli intelligence or military operations. In November 2013, Israeli officials were reportedly furious at the Obama White House for confirming the Israeli Air Force was behind a strike on a Syrian military base. Israeli policy is not to confirm strikes carried out beyond its borders. The Times of Israel reported at the time: Israel’s Channel 10 TV on Friday night quoted Israeli officials branding the American leak as “scandalous. ” For Israel’s ally to be acting in this way was “unthinkable,” the officials were quoted as saying. A second TV report, on Israel’s Channel 2, said the leak “came directly from the White House,” and noted that “this is not the first time” that the administration has compromised Israel by leaking information on such Israeli Air Force raids on Syrian targets. It said some previous leaks were believed to have come from the Pentagon, and that consideration had been given at one point to establishing a panel to investigate the sources. In 2012, Israel suspected the Obama administration had leaked information to prevent the Jewish state from striking Iran’s nuclear facilities. ABC News reported at the time: The first report in Foreign Policy quotes anonymous American officials saying that Israel has been given access to airbases by Iran’s northern neighbor Azerbaijan from which Israel could launch air strikes or at least drones and search and rescue aircraft. The second report from Bloomberg, based on a leaked congressional report, said that Iran’s nuclear facilities are so dispersed that it is “unclear what the ultimate effect of a strike would be  …    ” A strike could delay Iran as little as six months, a former official told the researchers. “It seems like a big campaign to prevent Israel from attacking,” analyst Yoel Guzansky at the Institute for National Security Studies told ABC News. “I think the [Obama] administration is really worried Jerusalem will attack and attack soon. They’re trying hard to prevent it in so many ways. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

11316,30052,George Soros-Financed Groups Scheme to Stop Trump’s Temporary Refugee Halt Order - Breitbart,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,1/28/2017,2017,1,,"TEL AVIV  —   Immigration lawyers from groups financed by billionaire George Soros, a champion of open border policies, were signatories to a lawsuit filed Saturday to block President Donald Trump’s executive order halting visas for 90 days for “immigrants and  ” from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Iran, and Iraq. [The executive order further suspended the entry of all refugees for 120 days, indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees from entering and lowers the ceiling to 50, 000 for refugees allowed to enter the U. S. during Fiscal Year 2017 .  The New York Times first reported on the lawsuit: At least one case quickly prompted a legal challenge as lawyers representing two Iraqi refugees held at Kennedy International Airport in New York filed a motion early Saturday seeking to have their clients released. They also filed a motion for class certification, in an effort to represent all refugees and other immigrants who they said were being unlawfully detained at ports of entry. The suit was filed by lawyers from the International Refugee Assistance Project, the National Immigration Law Center, the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the International Refugee Assistance Project (formerly Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project) at the Urban Justice Center. The ACLU is massively funded by Soros’s Open Society Foundations, including with a $50 million grant in 2014. The National Immigration Law Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support. The Urban Justice Center is also the recipient of an Open Society grant.  Taryn Higashi, executive director of the Center’s International Refugee Assistance Project, which is listed on the Trump lawsuit, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Soros’s Open Society Foundations. Over the last decade, Soros has reportedly provided some $76 million for immigrant issues. In 2014, the New York Times credited “immigrant rights groups” financed by Soros and a handful of other donors for influencing President Obama’s immigration policy. The newspaper reported: When President Obama announces major changes to the nation’s immigration enforcement system as early as next week, his decision will partly be a result of a yearslong campaign of pressure by immigrant rights groups, which have grown from a cluster of lobbying organizations into a national force. A vital part of that expansion has involved money: major donations from some of the nation’s wealthiest liberal foundations, including the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Open Society Foundations of the financier George Soros, and the Atlantic Philanthropies. Over the past decade those donors have invested more than $300 million in immigrant organizations, including many fighting for a pathway to citizenship for immigrants here illegally. In August, Breitbart Jerusalem first reported hacked documents from Soros’s Open Society Institute boasted that the billionaire and his foundation helped to successfully press the Obama administration into increasing to 100, 000 the total number of refugees taken in by the U. S. annually. The documents revealed that the billionaire personally sent President Obama a letter on the issue of accepting refugees.

11353,30089,EXCLUSIVE: Former Secret Service Agent Warns Trump ‘Not Secure’ in the White House - Breitbart,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,3/11/2017,2017,3,,"A former Secret Service agent who served in the security details of both Presidents Bush and Obama warned on Saturday that President Donald Trump “is not secure in the White House right now as it stands. ”[Dan Bongino, who was also an instructor at the training academy of the Secret Service, was commenting on Friday night’s reported breach of the White House complex, at least the seventh such incident in recent years.  Bongino stated: “If one guy with a backpack and Omar Gonzales with a bad knee could get near the residence of the White House, can you tell me with a straight face that a   tactical assault team with heavy weapons wouldn’t take that place down?” Bongino was referring to a 2014 incident in which Gonzales penetrated the north portico doors of the White House, reportedly brandishing a      folding knife in a back pocket. “This is inexcusable,” Bongino said of the latest incident. “How many of these are we, as the citizenry, going to tolerate, whether under Barack Obama or now President Trump, before there is enough citizen outrage that the Secret Service actually does something?” Bongino is the author of the bestselling 2013 book Life Inside the Bubble: Why a   Secret Service Agent Walked Away from It All. He also previously ran as a Republican for Congress and the Senate. He was speaking in an interview set to air Sunday on this reporter’s talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. “The secret service is not ready right now to defend the White House,” he charged. “They’re not. I know that may make people uncomfortable. And frankly, Aaron, I am really getting tired of some of the talking heads on cable news who have never done one minute in the shoes a secret service agent. ” “They have no idea what the security plan of the White House actually looks like on the ground. They’re all sitting here brushing it under the rug, going, ‘Oh no.’ ‘They were prepared.’ ‘This was a manageable incident.’ ‘This was how it was supposed to work.’ You really believe this is how it was supposed to work?” Regarding Friday night’s breach, Bongino warned, “Do you think that what happened today is not being beamed into every terrorists’ head, going, ‘Look at this fellows.’ I am sounding the alarm hoping and praying with fingers crossed that somebody wakes up and finally does what needs to be done. ” Bongino offered some security upgrade suggestions: “They need to fix the fence. Reinforce the manpower on the north and the south grounds. Add special weapons teams. Get the best technology in there right now. Clearly the technology sensors and cameras are not working as planned. Get them in there yesterday. There’s no other solution. ” Bongino outlined what he says are three major problems facing the Secret Service and the White House security plan. Problem number one, according to Bongino, involves staffing: They have had a brain drain of catastrophic portions in the Secret Service. They lost some of the best agents. If this wasn’t a public radio show that people could hear, I could tell you the names of ten or twenty   tier one guys who left the president’s detail just in the last 5 years who I still communicate with  …     They have had an even worse brain drain in the uniformed division side. They are responsible for the perimeter of the White House.   …    You can’t run a security agency without security officers who know what they’re doing. You just can’t. Problem number two, Bongino contended, is a lack of political will to address the purported security flaws: The management of the Secret Service right now is grossly unprepared for the evolving threats. Grossly. They say they are but they have no political will because a lot of them are out there  —   not all  —   but a lot are looking for their next consulting job. They are just praying that nothing happens on their next watch. They don’t want to be the ones to go on Capitol Hill to say this whole security plan around the White House needs to be fixed. And problem number three involves the actual security plan, he says: They are way too concerned right now, the management, with the optics of White House security. That we can’t make this look like an armed camp. The prior staff didn’t like that. There other entities around the White House that want to preserve the historic look of it. But do you want a secure White House grounds or do you want it to look pretty? CNN reported on Friday night’s breach: A man carrying a backpack was arrested Friday night after breaching security at the White House complex and was discovered by a Secret Service officer by the south entrance to the executive residence, officials said. The incident happened just before midnight while President Donald Trump was at the White House. The suspect, who had a California driver’s license, told Secret Service officers that he was there to see the president.

11393,30129,Soros-Funded Group Schemes to Stop Trump’s Latest Temporary Visa Ban,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,3/28/2017,2017,3,,"A lawsuit brought before a Maryland appeals court seeking to stop President Trump’s temporary ban on new visas from six Middle Eastern countries was filed by a   group financed by billionaire George Soros. [The second group behind the lawsuit was massively funded by the federal government under the Obama administration to resettle refugees within the U. S.  On Monday, Bloomberg reported on the status of the lawsuit: The   appeals court on Monday offered to accelerate its review of the case, which would speed it along to the U. S. Supreme Court by skipping the traditional oral argument before three judges in favor of an initial   hearing. The parties have until March 30 to decide if they want that accelerated schedule. The suit before the appeals court was filed by the International Refugee Assistance Project, HIAS, a refugee resettlement group established in the 19th century to aid Eastern European Jews, the Middle East Studies Association of North America and six individuals. Similar to the current suit, the International Refugee Assistance Project was also a signatory to a lawsuit filed last January attempting to block Trump’s original executive order halting visas for 90 days for “immigrants and  ” from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Iran and Iraq. The International Refugee Assistance Project is located at the Urban Justice Center. The Urban Justice Center is also the recipient of an Open Society grant. Taryn Higashi, executive director of the Center’s International Refugee Assistance Project listed in the Trump lawsuit, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Soros’s Open Society Foundations. The other group signed on to the lawsuit is the nonprofit HIAS, which describes itself as standing “for a world in which refugees find welcome, safety and freedom. ” Unmentioned in much of the news media coverage about the lawsuit is that HIAS has taken large sums in federal grants to help resettle refugees, as this reporter previously documented. HIAS specializes in refugee resettlement and in 2015 received 65. 3 percent of its annual $25 million budget from government grants. Annual grants include funds from the State Department and the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services.  Another major donor is the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In 2015, the State Department provided $17, 663, 704 and the Department of Health and Human Services gave another $2, 765, 195. The fiscal year 2014 saw a $16, 959, 850 State Department grant and $2, 546, 469 in funds from the Department of Health and Human Services. Guidestar documented that in 2013, HIAS received $16, 261, 661 from government and intergovernmental agencies and took in a total of $31, 218, 870 in revenue. In 2012, $14, 707, 399 in government grants were donated to HIAS and the organization produced $27, 677, 240 in revenue. In 2008, the Committee on   Organizations, a division of the UN Economic and Social Council, officially accepted HIAS as an accredited NGO. HIAS openly states on its website that it is the “only Jewish organization designated by the federal government to undertake” refugee resettlement, which “lies at the heart of HIAS’ work. ” The group is partners with local Refugee Assistance Organizations around the country to “ensure successful integration. ” “Although this can be a long process requiring the participation of many actors, refugees bring the resilience and resourcefulness that saved their lives at home,” HIAS relates. HIAS was an acronym that previously stood for the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and it originally worked to resettle Jewish emigrants from Russia.  It dropped the full title and only goes by the acronym now.  Mark Hetfield, HIAS president and CEO, told the Washington Jewish Week in December 2014 the word “Hebrew” was exclusionary and outdated, comparing it with the use of the word “colored” to refer to African Americans. Soros, meanwhile, has reportedly provided some $76 million for immigrant issues over the last decade alone. In 2014, the New York Times credited “immigrant rights groups” financed by Soros and a handful of other donors with influencing President Obama’s immigration policy. The newspaper reported: When President Obama announces major changes to the nation’s immigration enforcement system as early as next week, his decision will partly be a result of a   campaign of pressure by immigrant rights groups, which have grown from a cluster of lobbying organizations into a national force.

11674,30410,Soros Groups Behind Massive Anti-Trump Tax Day Protest Plot,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,2/16/2017,2017,2,,"The news media has been reporting on plans by a coalition of activist groups to hold a massive   Tax March in Washington and at least 60 other locations on April 15. [Unreported by the news media is that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by George Soros or have close links to Soros financing.  The website for the march, which is slated for the deadline for Americans to file their tax returns, claims that its mission is to get Trump to release his tax returns and more. The site relates: President Trump needs to be straight with the American people. To whom does he owe favors? Who are his policies really intended to benefit? Who will he put first? Working families are struggling to make ends meet, but we pay our fair share in taxes  —   does Donald Trump pay any at all? Organizers of the march claim to be “ordinary Americans, community organizers, advocates, and people from all walks of life and all backgrounds joining together to raise our voices and send a bold message to this administration. ” Leaders from January’s Women’s March coalition are reportedly helping to organize the Tax March, which USA Today described as a “sequel” to the massive women’s march. Buzzfeed took note of the comparison to the women’s march in a piece titled, “Progressives Want Tax Day To Be The Next Women’s March Protest. ” Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 “partners” of that march. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leaders’ close associations with Soros. In a section titled “Who is organizing it?” the website for the Tax March lists the following eight groups, six of which are either funded by Soros or tied to Soros financing. The Tax March is grateful to have the support of the following organizations: American Federation of Teachers, Americans for Tax Fairness, Center for Popular Democracy, Indivisible Project, MoveOn. Org, Our Revolution, and The Working Families Party. Americans for Tax Fairness is the recipient of a grant from Soros’s Open Society Foundations’ U. S. Programs. MoveOn. Org is financed by Soros. The American Federation of Teachers’ Educational Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the American Federation of Teachers, was financed by the Strategic Opportunities Fund of Soros’s Open Society Foundations, leaked Open Society documents show. The Center for Popular Democracy is led by   activists. In 2013, Marbre Stahly, a policy advocate at the Center, became a Soros Justice Fellow, which comes with a stipend of $58, 700 to $110, 250 to fund   activism projects that last between   months. The Center was listed as Stahly’s “host” for the grant. According to her bio, the Center’s research analyst, Maggie Corser, “spent four years at the Open Society Foundations where she conducted research on the future of work, conservative political infrastructure, and a range of economic justice issue. ” Shawn Sebastian, the Center’s field director for its Fed Up Campaign, was a fellow at the so called   Unit of the Open Society Foundations’ Justice Initiative. Another Tax March organizer is the   Indivisible Project. Earlier this week, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by Soros. Politico last week profiled Indivisible in an article titled, “Inside the protest movement that has Republicans reeling. ”  The news agency not only left out the Soros links, but failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisible’s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire, as Breitbart News documented.

11697,30433,Exclusive: Joy Villa Reveals Dream White House Gig,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,2/19/2017,2017,2,,"After making waves with a   dress at last Sunday night’s Grammy Awards and subsequently topping the singles chart on Amazon, singer Joy Villa revealed in an exclusive interview that she has one more goal in mind. [She wants to go to the White House and perform her rendition of Queen’s 1977 classic, “We Are The Champions,” for President Donald Trump.  “That is my goal,” she said of singing that song for Trump. “That is what I would love to do. I would like to show an outpouring of support and perform for the president. And that would be just the cherry on top of everything. “ Villa continued: “And also to create a wave of support for our president for Americans for patriotism and just for tolerance and love. And just changed the narrative. In the award shows. In the Grammys. In the red carpet. Anything that pops up. So it is a more fair portrayal of actually what Americans are feeling and thinking. Because we don’t all think like how they are telling us to think. And that is my whole platform. ” Villa was speaking in an interview to air on this reporter’s Sunday night talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM. Upon arriving at the Grammys, Villa took off a white robe to reveal a red, white and blue dress emblazoned with the sparkling words “Make America Great Again” and had “Trump” on the hem. Villa’s   Grammys appearance skyrocketed her album to #1 on Amazon’s digital chart. In an initial interview last week, Villa confirmed to this reporter that she is a Trump supporter and that she voted for the president. Asked why she decided to essentially troll the Grammys, Villa explained that she was “tired” of Hollywood’s treatment of Trump supporters. “I was tired of the bullying,” she said in a phone interview. “I was tired of being pushed down so that I couldn’t say my beliefs. And being fearful of losing sales. Losing fans. Losing bookings. Losing contracts and sponsorship. You know, that’s my day to day. And a lot of my friends have the same thing. And we live in Hollywood, which is supposed to be the most open viewpoint city. But the truth is there was a lot of hate and a lot of negativity and I wanted to change the storyline to love and support and unity as an American. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

11831,30567,Five Things to Watch for During Trump’s Israel Trip,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,5/21/2017,2017,5,,"JERUSALEM  —   On Monday, President Donald Trump will arrive here in Israel for a     visit that will include meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as visits to Jerusalem’s Western Wall, the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and the Israel Museum. [Here are five major things to look out for during Trump’s trip:  1  —   Will Trump keep his campaign pledge and move the U. S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Israel’s capital, Jerusalem? U. S. law requires the relocation of the embassy to Jerusalem. However, President Obama signed successive waivers delaying the move. The current waiver expires on June 1. Numerous reports in recent days cited White House officials saying that Trump is not expected to use the visit to announce an embassy move. Still, that prognosis is subject to change. “The president has not made a decision yet and is still reviewing that,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said last week. Even if Trump does not announce an embassy move, there are half measures that could be put into place, including the possibility of David Friedman, the U. S. ambassador to Israel, setting up shop at the U. S. consulate in Jerusalem instead of the beachfront embassy building in Tel Aviv. 2  —   Will Trump make policy declarations regarding the status of Jerusalem? It is not lost on observers that Trump will be in Jerusalem on Jerusalem Day, a national holiday here that marks Israel’s reunification of Jerusalem after the 1967 Six Day War and the establishment of Israeli sovereignty over the eastern sections of the city, which include the Old City, Western Wall and Temple Mount. Israel officially annexed Jerusalem in 1980 in a move not recognized by the international community because the Palestinians claim eastern sections of the city for a future Palestinian capital despite their never having had a state or entity in those areas. Current U. S. law does not officially recognize Israeli control over the eastern sections of the city, going so far as to prevent American citizens born in Jerusalem from listing “Israel” as their country of birth. All eyes will be on Trump to see if he makes any declarations regarding Israel’s status in Jerusalem. 3  —   Will Trump announce the launch of new, U. S.    negotiations? There are currently no plans for Trump to host a joint summit with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Instead, the focus will be on whether Trump plans to announce the relaunch of   talks aimed at creating a Palestinian state despite the Palestinian Authority’s history of rejecting each previous Israeli offer of a state and in recent years refusing to even come to the bargaining table. These offers were made at Camp David in 2000, Taba in 2001, the Annapolis Conference in 2007 and again in 2008. In each of these cases, the PA refused generous Israeli statehood proposals and bolted negotiations without counteroffers. The PA also failed to respond to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s unprecedented attempts to   negotiations aimed at creating a Palestinian state, including freezing Jewish construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem, and releasing Palestinian prisoners. U. S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said last week that the Trump administration does not plan to impose preconditions for talks and wants the two parties to iron things out. “As you can see, in contrast to what happened in 2009, when secretary [of state Hillary] Clinton demanded a complete settlement freeze and Abbas still didn’t show up to negotiate, here we have no demand for a settlement freeze and Abbas is prepared to meet with the prime minister of Israel without any preconditions,” he stated. There have been reports Trump is seeking to   talks for a period of six to twelve months without preconditions. 4  —   Will Trump express support for a plan beyond the     solution? Ever since the 1991 Madrid Conference and the largely failed 1993 Oslo Accords that legitimized   Yasser Arafat as a peace partner, the U. S. and international community have upheld the “two state solution” as the only framework for   negotiations. That “solution” calls for the creation of a Palestinian state with borders to be negotiated, but it is generally understood that such a state would encompass the Gaza Strip, major swaths of the West Bank and a foothold in eastern Jerusalem. Israeli frustration has grown after the PA turned down successive offers of a state and Abbas’s official government organs have continued to promote terrorism and the destruction of Israel. There has been widespread talk here about other ways to solve the   conflict, although the Israeli government has not officially proposed an alternative to the “  solution. ” Bucking the trends of the international community, Trump last February stated that the U. S. is open to possibilities outside the   framework. “I’m looking at   and   and I like the one that both parties like. I’m very happy with the one that both parties like,” Trump said at a White House press briefing with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 5  —   Will Trump call on Sunni Arab countries to prod the Palestinians into talks and make a deal that would create peaceful relations between Israel and the countries of the larger Mideast and Persian Gulf? The tectonic plates have shifted in this region following eight years of the Obama administration’s failed Mideast policies, especially the U. S.  nuclear deal with Iran. Sunni Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have reportedly been working behind the scenes with Israel to tackle the Iran threat, and relations between Israel and Sunni Arab countries have grown warmer as a result. Last week, the Washington Post reported Trump may use his trip to Saudi Arabia to unveil plans for a new “Arab NATO”  —   a military alliance that would work to combat the threat of the Islamic State and other terrorist groups. Trump could take advantage of these regional trends to nudge Sunni Arab countries not currently in a state of peace with Israel (only Egypt and Jordan have signed peace deals with the Jewish state) to come out of the closet and launch official diplomatic relations with Israel instead of behind the scenes diplomacy. Trump could also include these Arab countries in   talks in hopes of forging a larger regional deal that goes beyond the   conflict.

11838,30574,James Comey’s Democrat Critics Now See Russian Conspiracy in Trump’s Firing,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,5/10/2017,2017,5,,"While former aides to President Obama and members of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign predictably panned President Donald Trump for firing James Comey as FBI director, it was only a few months ago that Clinton’s campaign repeatedly alleged wrongdoing by Comey over his investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server. [And last October, Obama’s former attorney general, Eric Holder, signed his name to a letter circulated by Clinton’s campaign strongly criticizing Comey’s decision to publicize aspects of the FBI investigation, alleging Comey’s moves were inconsistent with FBI protocol.  In late October, less than two weeks before the presidential election, Comey informed key members of Congress that the FBI was reviewing additional emails that may have been relevant to the Clinton probe. This after emails were reportedly discovered on the personal devices of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of   top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. At the time, Clinton’s campaign circulated the   letter, signed by Holder as well as nearly 100 former federal prosecutors and   Department of Justice officials. The letter stated: “Many of us have worked with Director Comey all of us respect him. But his unprecedented decision to publicly comment on evidence in what may be an ongoing inquiry just eleven days before a presidential election leaves us both astonished and perplexed. ” ABC News reported on the letter: The authors of the letter said they were “moved” to speak out publicly because Comey’s action violated “settled” DOJ tenets. Justice Department officials are instructed to refrain from commenting publicly on pending investigations except in “exceptional circumstances,” as well as to “exercise heightened restraint near the time of a primary or general election,” said the letter. “We cannot recall a prior instance where a senior Justice Department official —   Republican or Democrat —  has, on the eve of a major election, issued a public statement where the mere disclosure of information may impact the election’s outcome, yet the official acknowledges the information to be examined may not be significant or new,” they wrote. The nearly 100 former DOJ officials who signed on to the letter wrote that Comey’s letter to Congress was inconsistent with prevailing department policy and that it broke with longstanding practices followed during past elections. “Perhaps most troubling to us is the precedent set by this departure from the Department’s     traditions,” they wrote. After Comey renewed the email probe in late October, Clinton herself called the FBI chief’s actions “deeply troubling. ” “It is pretty strange,” she said. “It’s pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information, right before an election. In fact, it’s not just strange it’s unprecedented and it’s deeply troubling. ” Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, said Comey had “not been forthcoming with the facts. ” However, now that Trump has fired Comey, with administration officials citing Comey’s handling of the Clinton email investigation, former Obama aides and Clinton officials claim to be dismayed. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein clarified the firing in a letter, writing, “I cannot defend the director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails. ” Yet Sen. Tim Kaine, Clinton’s running mate, claimed the firing was about the Russia investigation. “Trump firing Comey shows how frightened the Admin is over Russia investigation,” Kaine tweeted in response to the news. “Comey firing part of a growing pattern by White House to   the truth. ” Trump firing Comey shows how frightened the Admin is over Russia investigation,  —   Senator Tim Kaine (@timkaine) May 9, 2017,  Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, released the following statement: I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey’s handling of the email investigation, but President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called a “charade” only 24 hours ago. It’s equally concerning that our attorney general, who lied about his own meetings with the Russians, approved Director Comey’s firing. Clinton’s press secretary, Brian Fallon, tweeted, “I’m not shedding any tears for Comey personally  —   he hurt the FBI’s reputation  —   but I do worry whether we ever get to the bottom of Russia now. ” Former aides to Obama also claimed Trump fired Comey over the Russia investigation. “This should not be sugarcoated. Firing Comey is up there in terms of the scariest things Trump has done,” former Obama White House Communications Director Jen Psaki wrote on Twitter. Former Obama National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes expressed concern: “This is not normal. This is not healthy for a democracy.

11871,30607,Klein: New York Times Lobbies for Muslim Brotherhood,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,2/10/2017,2017,2,,"TEL AVIV  —   The New York Times in recent days has run numerous articles and opinion pieces advocating against designating the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization amid reports the Trump administration is debating doing just that. [The Muslim Brotherhood openly seeks to establish a worldwide Islamic caliphate based on Sharia law. While many Brotherhood wings reject the use of violence as a strategic tactic, preferring instead a sophisticated gradualist strategy to achieve their aims, the Brotherhood has spawned terrorist organizations  —   most notably Hamas  —   that adhere to its philosophy of a world order based on Islam. The Brotherhood was also a central player in the   Arab Spring, revolutions punctuated by violence across the Arab world.  Designating the Brotherhood a terrorist organization would add the U. S. to the growing list of nations to do so, including Muslim countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The Times’ propagation of the Brotherhood culminated in an editorial board piece published Thursday titled, “All of Islam Isn’t the Enemy. ” In the editorial, the newspaper warned designating the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization “would be seen by many Muslims as another attempt to vilify adherents of Islam. ”  The paper claimed that the possible designation “appears to be part of a mission by the president and his closest advisers to heighten fears by promoting a dangerously exaggerated vision of an America under siege by what they call radical Islam. ” The Times’ advocacy for the Brotherhood is particularly noteworthy since it separately posted a full Arabic document from 1991 in which an Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood member set forth a strategy for “eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within,” with emphasis on operations inside the U. S. In Thursday’s editorial, the newspaper laid out its case for the Brotherhood: There are good reasons that the Brotherhood, with millions of members, doesn’t merit the terrorist designation. Rather than a single organization, it is a collection of groups and movements that can vary widely from country to country. While the Brotherhood calls for a society governed by Islamic law, it renounced violence decades ago, has supported elections and has become a political and social organization. Its branches often have tenuous connections to the original movement founded in Egypt in 1928. Addressing the Brotherhood’s support for the electoral process and purportedly becoming a political organization, an extensive report on the Brotherhood by the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at Israel’s Center for Special Studies explained the group’s use of some tools of democracy to advance the aim of achieving a world ruled by Sharia law, which is by definition  . Drawing from founding Brotherhood documents and original literature by Brotherhood leaders, the Center explained: Unlike the militant factions of other Islamist movements, which completely rule out democracy on the basis of it being a Western, pagan, and ignorant idea, the Muslim Brotherhood does use the term “democracy. ” In its view, however, it has two main connotations: a tactical, instrumental means of taking over countries through the use of the democratic process, and an “Islamic democracy” based on Sharia law (i. e. Islamic religious law) and a model of internal consultation within the leadership, [Brotherhood Founder Sheikh Hassan]   listed seven stages to achieve these objectives, each to be carried out in a gradual fashion. The stages are divided into social and political: the first three are based on educating the individual, the family, and the entire society of the Muslim world to implement Sharia laws in every aspect of daily life. The next four stages are political in nature, and include assuming power through elections, shaping a Sharia state, liberating Islamic countries from the burden of (physical and ideological) foreign occupation, uniting them into one Islamic entity (“new caliphate”) and spreading Islamic values throughout the world. Sharia law is explicitly  . For example, under Sharia,   cannot rule over Muslims a Caliph can come to rule through force and seizure of power a woman inherits half that of a man and   cannot inherit from Muslims. In the Times editorial, meanwhile, the newspaper claimed that those “advising Mr. Trump seem unwilling to draw distinctions” between the Brotherhood and its violent adherents. The paper continued: Stephen Bannon, the chief White House strategist, once called the Brotherhood “the foundation of modern terrorism. ” And Frank Gaffney Jr. an   analyst who heads a small think tank, recently told the Times that the Brotherhood’s goals are “exactly the same” as those of the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. Both of these statements are true. The Brotherhood’s historic ideological principles of establishing a worldwide Caliphate are indeed shared by the Islamic State and   although their tactics greatly differ. And Brotherhood ideology has served as the foundation for groups like  . The defining works of Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader, ideologue and theorist Sayyid Qutb, considered the Brotherhood’s intellectual godfather, greatly influenced Osama bin Laden and   doctrine. An extensive March 23, 2003, article in the New York Times magazine by Paul Berman dissected Qutb’s writings as they relate to terrorist ideology. In the article titled “The Philosopher of Islamic Terror,” Berman documented the centrality of Qutb’s influence on  : The organization ( ) was created in the late 1980’s by an affiliation of three armed factions  —   bin Laden’s circle of ”Afghan” Arabs, together with two factions from Egypt, the Islamic Group and Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the latter led by Dr. Ayman   Al Qaeda’s top theoretician. The Egyptian factions emerged from an older current, a school of thought from within Egypt’s fundamentalist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, in the 1950’s and 60’s. And at the heart of that single school of thought stood, until his execution in 1966, a philosopher named Sayyid Qutb  —   the intellectual hero of every one of the groups that eventually went into Al Qaeda, their Karl Marx (to put it that way) their guide. In recent days, the Times has featured numerous other articles arguing against branding the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization. An article on Tuesday warned, “Officially designating the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization would roil American relations in the Middle East. The leaders of some American allies  —   like Egypt, where the military forced the Brotherhood from power in 2013, and the United Arab Emirates  —   have pressed Mr. Trump to do so to quash internal enemies, but the group remains a pillar of society in parts of the region. ” “Critics said they feared that Mr. Trump’s team wanted to create a legal justification to crack down on Muslim charities, mosques and other groups in the United States,” added the Times. “A terrorist designation would freeze assets, block visas and ban financial interactions. ” A Times article on February 1 was titled, “Trump Pushes Dark View of Islam to Center of U. S.  . ” The article lamented a worldview that “conflates terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State with largely nonviolent groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and its offshoots and, at times, with the 1. 7 billion Muslims around the world. ” A January 26 editorial titled “‘I Think Islam Hates Us’” informed readers the Trump administration “reportedly is considering designating the Muslim Brotherhood, which is involved in Muslim politics in a number of countries, as a terrorist organization. Some experts see the move as a chance for the Trump administration to limit Muslim political activity in the United States. ”  Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

11961,30697, Professional Activists Are Behind ‘Chaos’ Plot Targeting Trump Inauguration  ,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,1/18/2017,2017,1,,"While the protest movement plotting to disrupt   Donald Trump’s inauguration is largely attempting to portray itself as grassroots, in actuality professional   activists are leading the charge. [A main protest coalition group calls itself DisruptJ20. The organization’s website does not say much about who is behind the group. DisruptJ20 “rejects all forms of domination and oppression, particularly those based on racism, poverty, gender and sexuality, organizes by consensus, and embraces a diversity of tactics,” the site reads.  Claiming it stands for the vast majority of Americans, the group calls itself the “start of the resistance. We must take to the streets and protest, blockade, disrupt, intervene, sit in, walk out, rise up, and make more noise and good trouble than the establishment can bear. The parade must be stopped. ” DisruptJ20 is planning a slew of actions aimed, as the group relates, at “disrupting the ceremonies. ” According to the website, those actions include “spontaneous, unpermitted events,” an “unpermitted, anticapitalist march,” civil disobedience and disruption plans. Lacy MacAuley has been one of the main public faces of DisruptJ20, conducting numerous interviews with the news media as an activist with the group. Her contact details are listed on DisruptJ20’s website. From 2011 until the end of 2013, MacCauley, who turned down a Breitbart News interview request, served as a media activist at the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) which has received financing from George Soros’s Open Society Institute. IPS regularly partners with the   Center for American Progress to produce joint documents and reports on progressive issues. CAP was founded by John Podesta, the former chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Podesta previously served as a counselor for President Obama’s White House and chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. IPS and CAP previously released a “Unified Security Budget,” a list of defense spending recommendations that were partially adapted by the Obama administration. MacAuley’s IPS bio evidences her ties to professional leftist groups, including the controversial, now defunct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) Project Vote, and United for Peace and Justice. Her IPS bio reads: Lacy came to IPS after doing communications for a variety of progressive organizations through the progressive PR firm Massey Media LLC and as a single contractor. She has done media relations work with groups such as Project Vote and ACORN, United for Peace and Justice, Jubilee USA, Mountain Justice Summer, the IMF Resistance Network, and the Solidarity Center (international affiliate of the  ). The only other contact listed on DisruptJ20’s website is for organizer Legba Carrefour. Speaking to the Boston Herald, Carrefour made clear DisruptJ20’s intention is to cause “chaos” at the inauguration. “If the headline (on Jan. 21) is ‘Donald Trump inaugurated amid complete chaos and a cluster (expletive),’ then we won,” Carrefour said. “A lot of us are people who could be considered anarchists. None of us have respect for the office or the man. ” On his Twitter account, Carrefour describes himself as a “rather glam anarchist who lives, writes, and organizes a metric f*ckton of protests in Washington, DC. ” Another   protest organizer has been identified as Scott Green, a leader with the D. C.   Coalition. Green was captured allegedly plotting inauguration hijinks in an undercover video released yesterday by Project Veritas. “I was thinking of things that would ruin their evening, ruin their outfits and otherwise make it impossible to continue with their plans. So they get nothing accomplished,” Green says in the video. Green and his group were involved in violent protests in Sacramento in June. Local Fox40 reported: “I would use the word force.   and other fascists don’t back down, they can, and they ought to be made to back down,” said Scott Green, a supporter of the   Action group, also known as Antifa. Green, who used an alias while speaking to FOX40 for safety, did not attend the protest, but he says he has been present at similar ones that ended violently. Antifa itself isn’t new, but is an offshoot of the group   Action, which started in the late ’80s in Minneapolis. Anther activist caught allegedly plotting against the inauguration in the Project Veritas video is Luke Kuhn. “If you had a pint of butyric acid, I don’t care how big the building is, it is closing,” Kuhn says in the video during a conversation about setting off a chemical concoction to cause the evacuation of one of the planned inauguration balls. One Luke Kuhn protested President Bush’s inaugural in 2001 and was quoted at the time in the Baltimore Sun as a “veteran protester. ” Kuhn told the newspaper about his plans to bypass police checkpoints at Bush’s inauguration that year. “If people pass through the checkpoints and the police take their signs, the demonstrators will be made ineffective,” he said. “What I encourage people to do   …     have 30, 000 people march to one of the checkpoints and demand to get through. ” In February 2006, Kuhn led a   at a Minuteman Project rally on Capitol Hill against the U. S. guest worker program. Activist Dylan Petrohilos was also filmed by Project Veritas allegedly participating in the DisruptJ20 planning meeting. He doubles as a digital journalist for ThinkProgress, which is a media project of the     Center for American Progress.

12089,30825,DNC ’Russian Hacking’ Conclusion Comes from Google-Linked Firm,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,1/6/2017,2017,1,,"CrowdStrike, the   company relied upon by the FBI to make its assessment about alleged Russian hacking into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was financed to the tune of $100 million from a funding drive last year led by Google Capital. [Google Capital, which now goes by the name of CapitalG, is an arm of Alphabet Inc. Google’s parent company. Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, has been a staunch and active supporter of Hillary Clinton and is a longtime donor to the Democratic Party.  On Thursday, a senior law enforcement official told CNN that the DNC “rebuffed” the agency’s request to physically examine its computer servers after the alleged hacking. Instead, the FBI relied on CrowdStrike’s assessment that the servers had most likely been hacked by Russian agents. “The FBI repeatedly stressed to DNC officials the necessity of obtaining direct access to servers and data, only to be rebuffed until well after the initial compromise had been mitigated,” CNN quoted the senior law enforcement official as saying. “This left the FBI no choice but to rely upon a third party for information. These actions caused significant delays and inhibited the FBI from addressing the intrusion earlier. ” The news network was following up on a BuzzFeed report that first broke the story that the FBI did not examine the DNC’s servers before issuing a joint report with the DHS last week accusing Russian civilian and military intelligence services of compromising networks and infrastructure associated with the 2016 presidential election. Contrary to the claim from the FBI about being rebuffed, Eric Walker, the DNC’s deputy communications director, told BuzzFeed that the FBI never requested access to the servers. “The DNC had several meetings with representatives of the FBI’s Cyber Division and its Washington (DC) Field Office, the Department of Justice’s National Security Division, and U. S. Attorney’s Offices, and it responded to a variety of requests for cooperation, but the FBI never requested access to the DNC’s computer servers,” Walker wrote in the email. BuzzFeed further reported on the FBI’s reliance on CrowdStrike’s assessment about the alleged Russian hacking: The FBI has instead relied on computer forensics from a   tech security company, CrowdStrike, which first determined in May of last year that the DNC’s servers had been infiltrated by   hackers, the U. S. intelligence official told BuzzFeed News. “CrowdStrike is pretty good. There’s no reason to believe that anything that they have concluded is not accurate,” the intelligence official said, adding they were confident Russia was behind the widespread hacks. The CNN report also affirmed that the FBI relied on CrowdStrike’s findings. CrowdStrike is a   cybersecurity technology company   by experts George Kurtz and Dmitri Alperovitch. The company’s website explains the firm was founded because Alperovitch and Kurtz “realized that a brand new approach was needed  —   one that combines the most advanced endpoint protection with expert intelligence to pinpoint the adversaries perpetrating the attacks, not just the malware. ” In an Esquire profile, Alperovitch, a Russian expat, recalls he first discovered that Russia allegedly hacked into the DNC when one of his analysts installed a proprietary software package into the DNC’s system and immediately discovered the alleged Russian breach. “Are we sure it’s Russia?” Alperovitch says he asked the analyst. Esquire reported: The analyst said there was no doubt. Falcon had detected malicious software, or malware, that was stealing data and sending it to the same servers that had been used in a 2015 attack on the German Bundestag. The code and techniques used against the DNC resembled those from earlier attacks on the White House and the State Department. The analyst, a former intelligence officer, told Alperovitch that Falcon had identified not one but two Russian intruders: Cozy Bear, a group CrowdStrike’s experts believed was affiliated with the FSB, Russia’s answer to the CIA and Fancy Bear, which they had linked to the GRU, Russian military intelligence. Alperovitch then called Shawn Henry, a tall, bald     former executive assistant director at the FBI who is now CrowdStrike’s president of services. Henry led a forensics team that retraced the hackers’ steps and pieced together the pathology of the breach. Over the next two weeks, they learned that Cozy Bear had been stealing emails from the DNC for more than a year. Fancy Bear, on the other hand, had been in the network for only a few weeks. Its target was the DNC research department, specifically the material that the committee was compiling on Donald Trump and other Republicans. Meanwhile, a CrowdStrike group called the Overwatch team used Falcon to monitor the hackers, a process known as  . According to the Esquire story, Alperovitch was surprised when the DNC, which had contracted CrowdStrike for cybersecurity, wanted to go public about the alleged Russia hack, which took place at around the same time Donald Trump was being accused of having a relationship with Russia. Esquire documented: Hacking, like domestic abuse, is a crime that tends to induce shame. Companies such as Yahoo usually publicize their breaches only when the law requires it. For this reason, Alperovitch says, he expected that the DNC, too, would want to keep quiet. By the time of the hack, however, Donald Trump’s relationship to Russia had become an issue in the election. The DNC wanted to go public. At the committee’s request, Alperovitch and Henry briefed a reporter from The Washington Post about the attack. On June 14, soon after the Post story publicly linked Fancy Bear with the Russian GRU and Cozy Bear with the FSB for the first time, Alperovitch published a detailed blog post about the attacks. Google financing, CrowdStrike advertises on its website that it is “proud to have received major funding from some of the world’s most prestigious technology providers and investment firms”  —   most prominently Google Capital, which “led (a) $100M investment in CrowdStrike. ” “It’s extremely gratifying to bring in a   investor like Google Capital which shares our passion for innovation and sees the opportunity to completely transform the security industry,” CrowdStrike’s   and chief executive officer Kurtz said after the completion of the financing in July 2015. “As we continue to experience   this capital injection will help us firmly establish our   endpoint protection platform as the leading solution to address today’s sophisticated attacks and will allow CrowdStrike to further accelerate our domestic and international expansion. ” In November, Google Capital   itself and now goes by the name of CapitalG. It is a venture capital arm of Alphabet Inc. CapitalG explained: “Founded in 2013 in Mountain View, California, we began as Google Capital, a growth equity investment fund. We changed our name to CapitalG in 2016, after Google created Alphabet to serve as its parent company. Though our name has changed, our goal remains the same: to make   investments in leading companies around the world and help entrepreneurs rapidly grow their businesses. ” CapitalG’s website documents its close links to Google: “Our Google connection is our key asset. We call on experts from Google’s offices around the world to help our portfolio companies grow  …     CapitalG works with Google experts to advise on product, engineering, marketing, sales, operations, and other essential areas to help companies scale effectively. The Googlers draw upon knowledge from their day to day roles to offer valuable technical advice —  from scaling architecture, to making the transition to the cloud, to mobile development, to cybersecurity, and much more. ” Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, which owns CapitalG, has been a staunch and active supporter of Hillary Clinton. In November, the Wall Street Journal reported on an email released that month claiming Schmidt was “ready to fund, advise recruit talent” for Clinton’s campaign and that he “clearly wants to be head outside advisor. ” The Journal reported: Mr. Schmidt in April 2014 backed a startup dubbed Timshel that helped develop some of the technology behind Mrs. Clinton’s campaign website, including functions to sign up supporters and accept donations, according to the emails. Around that time, Mr. Schmidt sent a Clinton campaign official a lengthy memo with advice on running the campaign. He told campaign officials he was “ready to fund, advise recruit talent,” and “clearly wants to be head outside advisor,” according to a 2014 email from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta to campaign manager Robby Mook. Mr. Schmidt’s memo to Clinton aide Cheryl Mills is included in the leaked emails. Schmidt drew up a plan for Clinton’s campaign a year before she announced her White House bid, released emails showed. He sent the memo to top Clinton aide Cheryl Mills, chief of staff to Clinton when she was secretary of state. The Daily Mail reported: The Google titan outlined a number of things, including one Clinton definitely listened to  —   where she should base her campaign headquarters. ‘Its important to have a very large hiring pool (such as Chicago or NYC) from which to choose enthusiastic, smart and low paid permanent employees,’ Schmidt argued. He also nixed Washington, D. C. as an idea, even though it’s a thriving city for millennials. ‘DC is a poor choice as its full of distractions and interruptions,’ he wrote in the memo, emailed to Mills. She then passed it along to John Podesta, whose emails were hacked and made public by Wikileaks. Schmidt was spotted at Clinton’s nixed election night party wearing a “staff” badge. Meanwhile, Shawn Henry, president of CrowdStrike Services and CSO of the firm, is a retired executive assistant director of the FBI. “Henry, who served in three FBI field offices and at the bureau’s headquarters, is credited with boosting the FBI’s computer crime and cybersecurity investigative capabilities,” his CrowdStrike bio says. Last April, CrowdStrike General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer Steven Chabinsky was appointed to President Obama’s White House Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity. A CrowdStrike press release explained: Under the Commission, Chabinsky and 11 other industry leaders have been directed by the White House to recommend “bold, actionable steps that the government, private sector, and the nation as a whole can take to bolster cybersecurity in today’s digital world. ” President Obama, in an official statement, commended the members for bringing ”a wealth of experience and talent to this important role,” and charged the Commission with “the   task of identifying the steps that our nation must take to ensure our cybersecurity in an increasingly digital world. ” CrowdStrike   Alperovitch, meanwhile, has a bad taste for Russia, according to the Esquire profile: Alperovitch knows a thing or two about what the Russians call “active measures,” in which propaganda is used to undermine a target country’s political systems. He was born in 1980 in Moscow, in an era when people were afraid to discuss politics even inside their homes. His father, Michael, was a nuclear physicist who barely escaped being sent to Chernobyl as part of a rescue mission in 1986. Many of Michael’s close friends and colleagues died of radiation poisoning within months of flying to the burning power plant. The takeaway for Dmitri was that “life is cheap in the Soviet Union. ” Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council.  The Council takes a hawkish approach toward Russia and has released numerous reports and briefs about Russian aggression. The Council is funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc, the U. S. State Department, and NATO ACT. Another Council funder is the Ploughshares Fund, which in turn has received financing from billionaire George Soros’ Open Society Foundations. In an interview with PBS, host Judy Woodruff asked Alpervotich whether he had a conflict of interest in the alleged Russia hacking case since his firm, which was helping to publicize the Russia claims, was employed by the DNC. Here is a transcript of that section of the interview: JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, Dmitri Alperovitch, we want to point out and we said earlier, you were  —   your company was the one that uncovered this in the first place. You were working for the Democratic National Committee. Are you still working  —   doing work for them? DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: We’re protecting them going forward. The investigation is closed in terms of what happened there. But certainly, we’ve seen the campaigns, political organizations are continued to be targeted, and they continue to hire us and use our technology to protect themselves. JUDY WOODRUFF: I ask you that because if there’s a question of conflict of interest, how do you answer that? DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well, this report was not about the DNC. This report was about information we uncovered about what these Russian actors were doing in eastern Ukraine in terms of locating these artillery units of the Ukrainian army and then targeting them. So, what we just did is said that it looks exactly as the same to the evidence we’ve already uncovered from the DNC, linking the two together.

12116,30852,Marco Rubio Pushes Left-Wing Conspiracy Theory About Trump Advancing Russian Interests in Ukraine,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,6/13/2017,2017,6,,"During Tuesday’s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) pushed the misleading Democratic Party talking point that the Republican Party platform was changed to “not provide defensive weapons to Ukraine. ”[Here is a transcript of the relevant section of the hearing:   RUBIO: My last question, you were on the foreign policy team and the Republican platform was changed to not provide defensive weapons to Ukraine. Were you involved in that decision and do you know how the change was made?  SESSIONS: I was not active in the platform committee and did not participate in that, and I don’t think I had direct involvement. RUBIO: Do you know who did or you have no recollection of a debate about that issue internally in the campaign? SESSIONS: I never watched the debate, if it occurred, on the platform committee. I think it did. So I don’t recall that, Senator. I’d have to think about that. Rubio was alluding to the conspiracy theory that Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign had the Republican Party platform changed on the issue of Ukraine to allegedly aid Russian interests. The charge, which comes mostly from a Washington Post opinion piece, remains so unproven that even the   PolitiFact   fact checker failed to reach a judgement on the issue, allowing “it’s hard to use those news reports as evidence in this  . ” The entire issue revolved around one platform committee member, a Ted Cruz supporter, who wanted to use language calling for the U. S. to provide “lethal defensive weapons” to the Ukrainian military. Instead the platform eventually called for “appropriate assistance” to Ukraine  —   which leaves open the possibility of providing “lethal defensive weapons”  —   and called for “greater coordination with NATO defense planning. ” That was enough for the Washington Post’s Josh Rogin to pen an opinion piece titled “Trump campaign guts GOP’s   stance on Ukraine. ” MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow used the tidbit to claim on television that “something weird” happened regarding “that Ukraine and Russia thing” on the platform. She claimed the Trump campaign “jumped right up on that and they insisted that that plank only, that one, had to be taken out, that language could not stand. ” Writing at the Washington Examiner, media critic Byron York noted: Missing from all the talk is what the Republican platform actually said before it was allegedly “gutted” by Trump. What did the original draft of the platform say about Russia and Ukraine? Was it, in fact, changed? If so, how? As it turns out, a look at the original draft of the platform  —   which has never been released publicly  —   shows that it always had tough language on Russian aggression in Ukraine. And not only did that language stay in the final platform  —   nothing was taken out  —   it was actually strengthened, not weakened, as a result of events at the convention.   …     Not only that, the later, final platform contained a few additional words on Russia and Ukraine that weren’t in the original draft. To the first passage cited above, after “from the Baltic to the Caucasus,” the GOP platform committee added this: Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

12188,30924,New York Times Outs Israel as Source of Classified Intel Before Trump Visit,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,5/16/2017,2017,5,,"JERUSALEM  —   The rampant leaks concerning President Trump continued full speed ahead on Tuesday, with the New York Times quoting a “current and a former American official” saying it was Israel that provided classified intelligence purportedly disclosed by Trump during a White House meeting last week with Russian officials. [The report comes six days before Trump is due here in Israel for a visit and could potentially impact the U. S. relationship with Israel. Indeed, the second sentence of the Times report states that the information about Israel reportedly serving as the source “adds a potential diplomatic complication to the episode. ”  The Times failed to note its own report, if accurate, could endanger Israel’s antiterrorism intelligence collection operations. Continues the newspaper in the second paragraph of the article: Israel is one of the United States’ most important allies and a major intelligence collector in the Middle East. The revelation that Mr. Trump boasted about some of Israel’s most sensitive information to the Russians could damage the relationship between the two countries. It also raises the possibility that the information could be passed to Iran, Russia’s close ally and Israel’s main threat in the Middle East. However, toward the bottom of the piece, the Times cites Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser, as telling reporters that Trump was not aware of the source of the information. Israeli officials reached by the Times would not confirm that Israel provided the intelligence, which reportedly concerns the inner workings of the Islamic State. Israel’s U. S. ambassador, Ron Dermer, affirmed his trust in the U. S.  intelligence sharing relationship. “Israel has full confidence in our   relationship with the United States and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump,” Dermer told the Times by email. Yesterday, the Washington Post first reported that Trump allegedly revealed “highly classified information” during a meeting with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador, according to “current and former U. S. officials. ” The Post article acknowledged that as president “Trump has broad authority to declassify government secrets, making it unlikely that his disclosures broke the law. ” McMaster told the Post that “the president and the foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation. ” “At no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed, and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly,” McMaster stated. Later, McMaster stated the leak may put U. S. national security at risk. “I think national security is put at risk by this leak and by leaks like this,” he said. “And there are a number of instances where this has occurred and I think it’s important to investigate these sort of things. ” Trump tweeted he has the “absolute right” as president to share information. As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W. H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining  …    .  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017,  The Post claimed the information was provided through an unnamed U. S. ally: The information the president relayed had been provided by a U. S. partner through an   arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U. S. government, officials said. The partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia, and officials said Trump’s decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State. Now the Times has outed that ally as Israel, citing a “current and a former American official familiar with how the United States obtained the information. ” In January, Israel’s respected Yediot Ahronot newspaper reported U. S. intelligence officials from the Obama administration warned their Israeli counterparts not to trust then   Trump with intelligence secrets, citing alleged fears that Russia held blackmail information over Trump.  Those fears seemed to have been in part referencing the now partially debunked infamous dossier claiming that Russia collected compromising videos of Trump. The dossier, which contains wild and unproven claims about Trump and sordid sexual acts, including the mocked claim that Trump hired prostitutes and had them urinate on a hotel room bed, was compiled by former intelligence agent Christopher Steele, who was reportedly paid by Democrats and   Republicans to investigate Trump. Meanwhile, the Obama administration faced its share of accusations that it leaked sensitive Israeli intelligence or military operations. In November 2013, Israeli officials were reportedly furious at the Obama White House for confirming the Israeli Air Force was behind a strike on a Syrian military base. Israeli policy is not to confirm strikes carried out beyond its borders. The Times of Israel reported at the time: Israel’s Channel 10 TV on Friday night quoted Israeli officials branding the American leak as “scandalous. ” For Israel’s ally to be acting in this way was “unthinkable,” the officials were quoted as saying. A second TV report, on Israel’s Channel 2, said the leak “came directly from the White House,” and noted that “this is not the first time” that the administration has compromised Israel by leaking information on such Israeli Air Force raids on Syrian targets. It said some previous leaks were believed to have come from the Pentagon, and that consideration had been given at one point to establishing a panel to investigate the sources. In 2012, Israel suspected the Obama administration had leaked information to prevent the Jewish state from striking Iran’s nuclear facilities. ABC News reported at the time: The first report in Foreign Policy quotes anonymous American officials saying that Israel has been given access to airbases by Iran’s northern neighbor Azerbaijan from which Israel could launch air strikes or at least drones and search and rescue aircraft. The second report from Bloomberg, based on a leaked congressional report, said that Iran’s nuclear facilities are so dispersed that it is “unclear what the ultimate effect of a strike would be  …    ” A strike could delay Iran as little as six months, a former official told the researchers. “It seems like a big campaign to prevent Israel from attacking,” analyst Yoel Guzansky at the Institute for National Security Studies told ABC News. “I think the [Obama] administration is really worried Jerusalem will attack and attack soon. They’re trying hard to prevent it in so many ways. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
