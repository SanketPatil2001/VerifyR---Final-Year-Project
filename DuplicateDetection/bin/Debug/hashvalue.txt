" (CNN) You would be pressed to find a designer who appealed to the imagination as much as Alexander McQueen.  A favorite with   and fashion editors alike he was renowned for his Gothic sensibilities innovative textiles (think shells horns and hair) and highly conceptual runway shows as well as his bad boy antics behind the scenes. (Along with the usual drinks drugs and parties he once claimed to have stitched profanities into the lining of a jacket for Prince Charles.) Five years after his death interest in the designer hasn’t waned least of all in his home town of London where starting this month he’s being commemorated with an extensive expensive retrospective at the Victoria and Albert Museum.  Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty a   of the 2011 exhibition at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art summarizes and contextualizes McQueen’s   career through an elaborate display of 244 garments and accessories.  ”Savage Beauty at the VA is the largest and most ambitious fashion exhibition the museum has ever staged” said curator Claire Wilcox at a press preview. The VA has already sold 70 000 advanced tickets and extended the exhibition by two weeks to meet demand. At the Met Savage Beauty attracted over 660 000 visitors by the end of its   run making it one of the museum’s top 10 exhibitions of all time up there with a King Tut stop in 1978 and a Mona Lisa loan in 1963. The London connection  Bringing Savage Beauty to London can be seen as a ”homecoming” as it was described by VA director Martin Roth at the press preview if not an act of repatriation.  The son of cab driver and a school teacher Alexander ”Lee” McQueen grew up in London’s East End. After dropping out of school at 16 he honed his tailoring skills on Savile Row graduated with an MA in fashion design from the city’s prestigious Central Saint Martins college and used the VA’s archives to research his collections.  He once said of London: ”It’s where my heart is and where I get my inspiration.” That love was largely reciprocated. In 2011 thousands of British devotees petitioned to have Savage Beauty brought to London after its spectacular New York debut. Fashion journalist Melanie Rickey was one of the most vocal proponents. A longtime fan she has coauthored the upcoming release Inferno: Alexander McQueen (Laurence King) a coffee table book of interviews and images from photographer Kent Baker which documents March 1996 collection Dante. ”I was agitated because (Savage Beauty) really is meant to be in his hometown” Rickey says. ”Everything about him is London so to not have it in London would have been a crime.” Along with hounding the brand’s corporate honchos and the VA itself Rickey started an online petition to have the exhibition brought to the city and instigated the Twitter hashtag #BringMcQueenExhibitionHome. ”It’s like the (Elgin) Marbles: They’re probably a lot more powerful in Greece than they are sitting in the British Museum.” Ultimately such advocacy may have been unnecessary. According to Kate Bethune senior exhibition research assistant for Savage Beauty it had been Roth’s ambition to bring the exhibition to London since he assumed the directorship in September 2011. The VA exhibition which was announced last April even begins with a newly added London gallery dedicated to McQueen’s roots in the city and his early shows.  Inside Savage Beauty Curators called on Sam Gainsbury who produced all of McQueen’s shows from 1996 on to act as the exhibition’s creative director and bring McQueen’s pieces to life. ”A lot of (McQueen’s) colleagues say he started his collections with the concept of a show” Bethune says. ”He always wanted people to have a strong reaction to what he was going.” The most theatrical highlights include the Romantic Primitivism gallery covered with fake bones like an ossuary and a   room where a Kate Moss hologram floats in a diaphanous dress trapped in a glass pyramid.  The   Cabinet of Curiosities has 27 screens showing moments of his most imaginative runway shows: women walk on water a model’s gown is   by robotic arms a church is converted into a catwalk. But Bethune believes the real draw will be the groundbreaking pieces made from unconventional materials which blur the line between fashion and art. Fairytale gowns feature throughout and there’s a whole section dedicated to McQueen’s tailoring skills but it’s the garments made from razor clam shells pheasant feathers and synthetic hair or embellished with impala horns and baby crocodile heads that really standout. The accessories    extravagant headpieces Swarovski mesh chain mail impossible shoes    seem like sculptures. ”McQueen was an artist whose medium of expression was fashion” she says. ”He absolutely changed the way we look at fashion.” Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty runs from March 14   August 2 2015 at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

20153"Des Moines Iowa (CNN) For Iowa’s economy corn is everything. So it’s no surprise that the Republican governor and other powerful voices in state agribusiness are vocal backers of the Renewable Fuel Standard a federal rule that requires gasoline to be comprised of up to 10% in renewable fuels. One of those is ethanol    with corn often a key ingredient. ”Don’t mess with the RFS” Gov. Terry Branstad said Saturday offering a not so subtle warning as he kicked off a daylong agriculture summit that featured a string of likely Republican presidential candidates. The RFS is a major issue that White House hopefuls are forced to address whenever they visit the No. 1   state that also goes first in the presidential nominating calendar.   But it’s a less popular policy for small government conservatives who decry the mandate as federal overreach in the private sector.  In his first 2016 visit to Iowa Jeb Bush sought to delicately explain his desire to see the RFS disappear over time. ”The market’s ultimately going to have to decide this” he told the audience at the event which took place at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. Bush acknowledged that the mandate which passed in 2007 has helped lower dependence on foreign oil and boost   economies.  ”But as we move forward over the long haul there should be certainty for people to invest” he argued saying ethanol will no longer need help from the government. ”So at some point we’ll see a reduction of the RFS need because ethanol will be such a valuable part of the energy feedstock for our country.” He declined however to suggest when exactly that may happen.  In his remarks Bush also defended his position in favor of legal status for undocumented immigrants after they meet a wide set of requirements. And while attending a fundraiser Friday night in Des Moines he stood by his support for Common Core the controversial testing standards that have become a point of contention for conservatives.  Election 2016: Jeb Bush makes his first Iowa foray Bush’s frank statements on the RFS and his defense of some of his most controversial views indicated that the former Florida governor plans on sticking with his positions as he gets ready to hit the campaign trail no matter how unpopular they may be to certain audiences.  Still he was not totally immune to at least some pandering. Bush told the crowd that he’ll be cooking some ”Iowa beef” Sunday when he’s back home with his family in Florida adding that he’ll probably make some ”really good guacamole” too.  Talking about campaigning for his father’s presidential campaigns in Iowa Bush said he went to at least 50 counties. ”I remember eating really well    eating really really well.” Ag issues in the spotlight With a John Deere tractor towering near the stage each candidate sat on stage for a   QA with Bruce Rastetter an agribusiness entrepreneur and major Republican donor in Iowa. The audience of close to 1 200 was comprised largely of farmers and other leaders in the agriculture industry.  While Bush took a mild approach to the RFS Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas flat out opposed it saying Washington shouldn’t be ”picking winners and losers.”  ”I have every bit of faith that businesses can continue to compete and continue to do well without having to go on bended knee asking for subsidies asking for special favors” he said. ”I think that’s how we got in this problem to begin win.” Ethanol proponents argue that because oil companies own gas stations consumers are unable to access ethanol and therefore it needs the government’s support to break through oil’s stronghold of the market.  Cruz acknowledged that his view wouldn’t be   but tried to argue that it proved his authenticity.  ”Look I recognize that this is a gathering of a lot of folks who the answer you’d like me to give is ’I’m for the RFS darn it.’ That’d be the easy thing to do. But I’ll tell ya people are pretty fed up I think with politicians that run around and tell one group one thing tell another group another thing.” Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry took a similar stance and defended his decision to request a waiver that would exempt Texas from the federal mandate. If individual states want to require that ethanol be used in gasoline that’s fine he said but not the federal government.  ”I philosophically don’t agree that Washington D. C. needs to be making these decision that affect . .. our agriculture industry” Perry said.  ’We better suck up to them’  Other contenders offered entirely opposite positions. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for example said he ”absolutely” supports the RFS.  ”That’s what the law requires. So let’s make sure we comply with the law. That should be the minimum” he said drawing applause from the crowd.   Rick Santorum who won the Iowa caucuses in 2012 ticked off what he called a ”laundry list” of benefits including more energy independence and more jobs for farmers.  ”It is very important for rural Americans” said the former senator from Pennsylvania.  For his part Mike Huckabee argued that the ethanol mandate was a matter of national security.  ”America needs to do three things to be free: feed itself fuel itself fight for itself” the former Arkansas governor said adding that relying on foreign governments for energy leads to a weakened United States.  Huckabee who won the Iowa caucuses in 2008 hit back at criticism that politicians like him simply support the RFS for political reasons.  ”The decisions are made not just frankly for what’s best for Iowa    that’s not the rationale. You can’t make a decision and say ’It’s good for Iowa. Gee they’re the caucus state we better suck up to them.’ We better make decisions that are good for every consumer” he said.  Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker who’s had a strong showing in polls since he visited the state in January made clear that while he’s generally a free market guy he believes ethanol is being blocked from consumers and needs government assistance.  ”Right now we don’t have a free and open marketplace and so that’s why I’m willing to take that position” he said.  But similar to Bush Walker said that he expects ethanol can one day compete openly and ”you no longer need in the industry to have these subsidies.” The audience at Saturday’s event was largely subdued given the tone and dialogue of the summit was more substance less red meat. Those who supported the RFS however received a strong response from the crowd.  As for those who opposed it Bill Couser who   a campaign called America’s Renewable Future which pushes the ethanol mandate said he’s not ready to write anyone off quite yet. But those candidates can expect to hear a lot more from him in the coming months.  ”Maybe I didn’t like a few of their answers but it’s going to give me some time to go help them understand the issues” he said.

"DES MOINES Iowa (CNN) The 2016 Republican presidential race in Iowa got its unofficial start Saturday with a marathon of speeches giving close to a dozen potential candidates a chance to introduce (or  ) themselves to a core group of   roughly one year before the contest. Immigration and Islamic extremism took front and center as the White House hopefuls sought to   their stump speeches. On style it was Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz who saw strong receptions from the audience though support for a wide number of candidates was expressed in the hallways after the event. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also sought to establish a deeper bond with Iowa. The Hawkeye State receives outsized attention in presidential years thanks to its     status during the primary season.  Marathon time For the   day of    speeches ”the candidates”    as they were called     joined other   Republicans at Hoyt Sherman Place an old intricate theater built in 1877 that also became the first public art museum in Des Moines. Billed as the Iowa Freedom Summit the event was   by Citizens United and Rep. Steve King a revered lawmaker who represents the northwestern part of the state and has considerable clout among the more social conservative and Christian right faction of the party.  It was no secret that it was considered a cattle call for the presidential race. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee for example said that the reason he ended his Fox News show was for a bigger goal he has in mind.  ”It wasn’t just so I can go deer hunting every weekend I can assure you that” he said.  Others were more blatant.  ”I am a potential presidential candidate yes I am” former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina told CNN.  Even Palin angled to get in on some of the action teasing ahead of her appearance Saturday that she was now seriously considering a run. And real estate titan Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that he’ll make his decision before June.  ”I’m the one person who can make this country great again that’s all I know” he told reporters Saturday. ”Nobody else can.” Palin in her remarks was less forward. Ticking through a somewhat dizzying and    speech Palin suggested that the country is ready for a woman leader    just not Hillary Clinton.  ”Hey Iowa can anyone stop Hillary?” she said prompting the audience to cheer. ”To borrow a phrase yes we can!” The class of 2016 The speakers who were typically allotted 20 minutes used a bulk of their speeches to share their own personal upbringings. Ben Carson and Christie talked about their strict but sharp mothers while Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz talked about having pastors as fathers. Other more   names in Iowa  —   like former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum who won the state’s caucuses in 2012 and Huckabee who won in 2008  —   tried to remind Iowans why they picked them in the first place dipping into their personalities but also focusing on the issues.  Given King’s firebrand credentials as an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration it was no surprise that problems at the border became a focal point in much of the speeches Saturday.  Carson a retired neurosurgeon argued ”there wouldn’t be people coming in here if there wasn’t a magnet pulling them in” suggesting there should be criminal punishment for employers who hire undocumented workers.  The main target in the immigration battle however was President Barack Obama’s executive action to delay deportation for up to five million undocumented immigrants. Or as Palin put it in her folksy swagger Obama’s decision makes him seem ”like an overgrown little boy who’s just acting kinda spoiled.” Speakers railed against the President’s pledge to use his ”pen and his phone” to work around Congress with immigration as just one example of what many called the president’s ”overreach.” That was punctuated when DREAM Act Coalition protesters interrupted Rick Perry’s speech leading to one arrest and theater full of Iowans trying to drown out the demonstrators’ chants.  The potential candidates also warned about what they see as a dire path for the country in particular when it comes to foreign policy a theme that along with immigration also seems poised to become a flash point in the 2016 presidential race unlike in 2012.  Santorum argued that the growth of ISIS is a consequence of the ”isolationism” and ”weakness” from the Obama’s administration. Cruz like several speakers said the President will fail in the war on terror if he refuses to use the words ”radical Islamic terrorism.” Huckabee blasted Obama for devoting more time to climate change in the State of the Union address than talking about terrorism.  ”A beheading is a far greater threat to Americans than a sunburn” Huckabee said.  The issues There was plenty of the usual Iowa charm on stage speeches with pig analogies and corn references. And there was more than one reference to how people in Iowa are somehow taller than average.  Shown on a big screen above the stage was an image of a red barn sitting on a green hill surrounded by white fences. Steve King’s name  —   in all caps  —   was plastered across banners on the stage as well as the podium. The contenders also dished out a bevy of red meat blasting Obamacare Common Core the media Hillary Clinton and the $18 trillion debt. Cruz won huge applause for proposing to place 110 000 IRS employees on the southern border joking that they’ll do a better job at deterring illegal immigration than anything else.  Giving a shout out to the state’s newly elected U. S. senator Joni Ernst was also a popular item on the agenda for the potential candidates. Nearly all of them referred to her as their ”friend” and almost equal amount of affection and time was dedicated to the state’s other beloved senator Chuck Grassley.  Walker who like Cruz paced the stage back and forth as he spoke delivered an impressive speech that honed in on his record as governor. He talked about implementing voter ID laws and he painted himself as the valiant warrior who took on the public employees and won during the collective bargaining rights debate of 2011.  He also didn’t forget to mention that he’s been elected three times in the past four years.  Shortly after his speech two men both from Council Bluffs talked outside about how they were wowed by Walker’s remarks.  ”If he could do on a nationwide scale what he did in Wisconsin this country would be” one man Michael Patomson started to say before his friend Bill Hartzell interjected: ”Transformed. The country would be transformed.”  The reception Many attendees had a hard time picking just one favorite in the line of potential contenders. Several mentioned Fiorina as a surprise hit.  ”There was just a pantheon of people to listen to” said Eric Rosenthal of Cedar Rapids.  ”Rick Perry was better than last time I heard him  —   that’s good. He needs it” said Ernie Rudolph of Dallas County Iowa.  Christie also saw a warm reception and contested the idea that a Republican governor of a blue state who has a ”Jersey guy” reputation will not connect with voters in Iowa.  ”That somehow I’m too loud I’m too blunt and I’m too direct” Christie said dismissing the criticism as ”conventional wisdom” from Washington pundits. ”They’re wrong.” Still he was noticeably different from his usual style. His demeanor was toned down and he read from his prepared remarks on the podium a stark contrast to his preferred    method.  Some of the chatter in the hallways and to reporters also featured two potential contenders who weren’t there: Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney.  Trump put it simply: ”Mitt had his chance. He should have won and he choked.” As for Bush: ”We’ve had enough of the Bushes.”  Sens. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio as well as Gov. Bobby Jindal also skipped the event but given that it’s year ahead before Iowans start to caucus it’s unlikely that missing one event will hurt them.  Saturday’s event was more of a curtain raiser giving the first glimpse of what will likely be a competitive Republican primary.  Walker as he closed his speech offered a pledge that will likely be mirrored by several of the speakers on stage over the next year: ”I’m going to come back many more times.”"~8214ec006f5f8709e78b0a93729c3cc1e528bc58
"Los Angeles (CNN) Thousands of veterans who are patients at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System have been waiting months just for an appointment CNN has learned.  What’s more administrators in charge of the massive VA facility in greater Los Angeles may have been hiding wait times and may have misled Congress on the delays and exactly how long veterans are being forced to wait for care according to new information obtained by CNN.   This revelation means that the scandal over delays in care and wait times for veterans which embroiled the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs last year and even led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki is apparently not over. And the changes promised by the VA and the Obama administration may not be working. The detailed new evidence comes from the Los Angeles VA’s own internal documents obtained by CNN and numerous medical and administrative sources confirmed the information.  It is particularly significant as the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Medical Center is the nation’s largest VA health care system caring for hundreds of thousands of U. S. veterans.  The VA documents show more than 12 700 appointments which the VA calls consults had been waiting more than 90 days to be addressed as of  .  Even new patients seeking care at the Los Angeles VA for the first time can wait months to see a doctor there. Records show on January 15 more than 1 600 veterans who were new patients were waiting 60 to 90 days for appointments. Another 400 veterans have waited up to six months and 64 veterans had been waiting six months to a year for their appointments. The documents provided to CNN show the lengthy wait times are still happening within the last several months and sources say the backlog is happening even now.  And yet last month the VA’s acting director for the Western region overseeing the Los Angeles VA told Congress that veterans who are new patients there only have to wait a few days for appointments. ”The average wait time for a new patient right now is about four days” Dr. Skye McDougall the acting director of the Desert Pacific Healthcare Network Veterans Health Administration testified before the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. But McDougall’s statement is simply not true.  According to the Los Angeles VA’s documents dated January 15 the actual average wait time for new patients at the VA was 48 days. A   medical and administrative sources inside the LA VA system corroborate these waits.  The wait times since then have not changed significantly    coming down slightly to a wait time of 44 days for new patients as of March 1 according to another VA document    and are still roughly 10 times what McDougall testified they were. The delays in appointments are even taking place at Los Angeles clinics for mental health where documents show more than 300 veterans have been waiting more than 30 60 even 90 days for treatment. At the congressional hearing McDougall was specifically asked about mental health wait times for new patients a growing national concern as hundreds of veterans are committing suicide every year.  The uncounted: War’s true toll Asked how long the wait time is for mental health at the Los Angeles VA McDougall testified that the same number    a four days’ wait for new patients    applies for mental health.  But that is also not true according to the documents and sources inside the VA who spoke with CNN.  A new LA VA chart shows as of March 1 new mental health patients in Los Angeles are waiting an average 36 days just to get an appointment.  Los Angeles VA officials would not talk to CNN about the discrepancies but instead sent a statement saying that the ”Greater Los Angeles and VA nationwide continues to work very hard to get Veterans off waiting lists and into clinics to get the care they have earned and deserve.”  The VA sent CNN new ”retrospective data” showing primary care average wait times of four days specialty care wait times of 7. 5 days and mental health wait times of 2. 5 days as of January. The VA explained that the chart for new patients obtained by CNN ”does not include same day appointments or in some cases same week appointments for those Veterans who need care quickly. ...”  New patients the VA told CNN ”typically account for less than 10% of all Veteran appointments and are not representative of the whole patient population.”    Despite the ”retrospective data” the real truth say the sources CNN has interviewed is reflected in the internal LA VA documents obtained by CNN    that wait times for many patients at the Los Angeles VA Medical Centers extends into weeks and months and are a serious problem. This news of continuing delays in Los Angeles comes a year after reports of   and turmoil at the VA which became a national scandal where wait times veterans’ deaths and even secret waiting lists were revealed at VA hospitals across the country.  Congress even passed a new law last fall to help veterans get care more quickly as a direct result of the scandal. And since the scandal Congress has approved $16 billion extra for the VA in an attempt to hire more doctors and nurses and to build more facilities. The VA removed its   scheduling goal to discourage engaging in ”inappropriate scheduling practices” and President Barack Obama also appointed a new VA secretary Robert McDonald last summer. Vets not impressed with VA reforms Sources in the Greater Los Angeles VA say despite the scandal last year the new secretary the new laws and all the attention not much has changed.

"New Delhi India (CNN) The North Korean ambassador in Bangladesh issued an apology after one of the embassy’s diplomats was caught carrying 27 kilograms (59 pounds) of undeclared gold into the country’s main airport in Dhaka according to officials in Bangladesh.  North Korean officials could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile state media in the largely isolated communist country has not yet reported on the incident. Kazi Muhammad Ziauddin a top official in Bangladesh’s customs agency told CNN his officers discovered the gold on the afternoon of March 5th after the diplomat arrived on a Singapore Airlines flight. Ziauddin said customs officials had received a confidential tip that a North Korean diplomat would be carrying ”illegal items.” ”It was very tough. We have to be very careful and sensitive when we deal with a diplomat” Ziauddin said referring to the Vienna Convention which affords diplomats certain degrees of consular immunity. Bag searched He said the suspect whom he identified as Son Young Nam the first secretary of North Korea’s embassy in Dhaka initially refused to allow his baggage to be searched. ”He said there is no way we can open or scan his bag” Ziauddin said. ”At first he said ’This is an electric motor.’  After further questioning he changed his mind and told us ’These are cipher machines and very confidential. ’” Eventually customs officers opened the diplomat’s bag and found the undeclared goods that included 170 gold bars and golden ornaments. At current market prices the gold would be valued at around $1 million. Entering Bangladesh without declaring this quantity of precious metal is a violation of the country’s customs regulations.  An official with Bangladesh’s Foreign Secretary speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity said his government lodged a protest with the North Korean ambassador.  North Korea sanctions It’s far too early to jump to conclusions about whether the alleged gold smuggling incident could be an isolated example of corruption or an effort to move official funds. Due to international sanctions North Korea faces substantial obstacles when trying to access international banking systems.  ”It would be interesting to see if [the diplomat] is disciplined when he gets back” to North Korea said John Delury associate professor at Yonsei University’s Graduate School of International Studies. ”That would be a way of saying whether or not he’s a corrupt diplomat.”  According to the Foreign Secretary’s office in Bangladesh the North Korean diplomat allegedly caught carrying the gold has since left the country."~40dcd98b8daa20455fbece34320687331f0c0d22
2" (CNN) Even at the age of 7 Lotte Hershfield knew her world was crumbling. She avoided the benches with the sign: No dogs or Jews allowed. She couldn’t attend public schools. And the Nazis and their growling German shepherds raided her family’s house throwing their books into a fire. As a child ”we were very aware” said Hershfield now 84. Jews weren’t welcome in their own home. Growing increasingly fearful her parents and her older brother left their hometown of Breslau Germany in 1938 and journeyed to an unlikely new home    the Philippines. About 1 200 European Jews fled to the Philippines from 1937 to 1941 escaping the throes of the Nazis only to face another bloody war under Japanese occupation.   Many of the Jews came from Austria and Germany as the   policies including the Nuremberg race laws intensified. Unable to immigrate to countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States thousands of Jews escaped to places such as Shanghai in China Sousa in the Dominican Republic and Manila. Those who arrived in Manila didn’t realize that they had escaped the Holocaust only to be caught in the war in the Eastern Front where the Philippines came under attack.  ”We were going from the frying pan to the fire” Hershfield said. ”We went from Nazi persecutors to the Japanese.” The Philippines capital was liberated after a grueling monthlong campaign in the Battle of Manila one of the bloodiest battles of World War II which now marks its 70th anniversary.  From persecution to a welcome This little known chapter of history about Jewish refugees in the Philippines has inspired two documentaries and talk of a possible movie. ”We know about stories like Anne Frank ’Schindler’s List’    the things that grab popular imagination” said Michelle Ephraim whose father Frank Ephraim escaped to the Philippines after Kristallnacht in 1938. ”Once you bring an Asia element it becomes so complicated interesting and surprising.” About 40 of the Philippines refugees are alive today according to documentary filmmakers. They were children when they arrived in the Philippines over 70 years ago. ”That was like a rebirth” said Noel Izon the filmmaker of the documentary ”An Open Door: Jewish Rescue in the Philippines” in which he interviewed several Jewish refugees. ”They went from certain death to this life.” Among them was Frank Ephraim who arrived in Manila at the age of eight. He recounted his experience in his biography ”Escape to Manila: From Nazi Tyranny to Japanese Terror.” ”My father got a lot of positive attention coming from a place where Jews were exiled and treated so poorly” said his daughter of his escape from Europe. Frank Ephraim died in 2006.  ”The Filipinos were incredibly kind and treated him extremely well. There was an element of something so redemptive.” How the Philippines became a haven Manuel Quezon the first president of the Philippine Commonwealth and a group of Americans that included future U. S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Freiders the   brothers became increasingly concerned about the treatment of Jews in Europe during the late 1930s.  ”They had a shared view of the world they were men who understood what was happening in Europe” said Russ Hodge   of the documentary ”Rescue in the Philippines.” That documentary was screened in the Philippines with the country’s president Benigno Aquino in attendance last year.  Over poker the men devised a strategy to bring Jewish refugees to the Philippines.   The Philippines Commonwealth remained under U. S. supervision so it could not accept people who would need public assistance. The refuge committee sought highly skilled professionals such as doctors mechanics and accountants.  By 1938 a stream of refugees arrived including a rabbi doctors chemists and even a conductor Herbert Zipper who survived Dachau concentration camp and later became the founder of the Manila Symphony.  Quezon’s ambitions to settle 10 000 Jews in the southern island of Mindanao were dashed as the the war arrived to the shores of the Philippines.  A new home in the tropics For the European Jews who arrived in the Philippines ”it was a cultural shock” said Hershfield. ”We didn’t know the language. We had never seen any other than white people before.” The humidity was thick the heat overpowering and the mosquitoes gigantic.  But the young Jewish refugees saw the Philippines as a new adventure. Children climbed mango trees swam in the bay and learned Filipino songs.  Hershfield became friends with local neighbors played sipa (a local kicking game) and relished tropical fruit such as papaya and guava. Life in Manila was running around in sandals and summer clothes. The experience differed for her parents. ”It was very difficult for my parents” she said. ”They never really learned Tagalog. They had been westernized and they stayed mostly within their circle of other immigrants.” Many of them lived in crowded community housing where fights would break out. They had gone from being wealthy in Germany to having nothing. ”It wasn’t what they’d known before in Germany” Izon said. ”At the same time ”they were able to practice their religion able to intermingle and have businesses.” Hershfield’s idyllic days of playing under the Manila sun came to an abrupt end as the war came ashore to the Philippines.   Japanese occupation Starting in 1941 the Japanese occupied the Philippines. In some respects the Jewish refugees were treated considerably better than Filipinos. What ironically protected the Jews was their German passports with the swastikas    they were viewed as allies.   ”It occurred to me later that’s what kept us from being interned” said Ursula Miodowski who was 7 years old at the time.  The Japanese interned British and American residents in camps. Filipinos and American soldiers were forced to march 65 miles in the infamous Bataan Death March in which an estimated 10 000 prisoners died.   Japanese officers confiscated residents’ homes and also hoarded crops for its military. The local economy shriveled and food became scarce. Life under the Japanese was hard and brutal surviving refugees said. When Allied forces began taking back the Philippines bombs fell daily. Families hid in bomb shelters not knowing where the next one would fall. Frank Ephraim spent days hiding in a ditch shaking with a mattress covering his head. One of Hershfield’s friends died after stepping on a mine.  ”Fires were going on all the time” said Hershfield. ”You could see the black clouds smell of bodies lying there and decaying.” As the Japanese were losing Manila the imperial troops launched a brutal urban campaign. Rapes torture beheadings and bayoneting of civilians were widely reported so much so that a Japanese general Tomoyuki Yamashita was later executed for having failed to control his troops.  ”The Japanese decided to destroy Manila. They were going to give them a dead city they set about doing that” said Miodowski. ”They burned they killed.” But war time in the Philippines was ”preferable to being in a concentration camp” she said.  The monthlong urban street fighting for Manila left the capital in ashes decimating its economy and infrastructure. The Philippines suffered nearly a million civilian deaths during the war. Despite the trauma of facing both fronts of the war Hershfield remains grateful. ”We would not be alive today if not for the Philippines. We would’ve been destroyed in the crematorium.” Refuge remembered In 2009 a monument honoring the Philippines was erected at the Holocaust Memorial Park in the Israeli city of Rishon Lezion. The monument shaped like three open doors thanks the Filipino people and its president for taking in Jewish refugees during the Holocaust. Many of the descendants of the Jewish refugees who fled to the Philippines have not forgotten their family’s place of refuge.  When Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines in November 2013 the disaster brought in relief workers from the American Jewish Distribution Committee.  Danny Pins who is related to Hershfield and is the son of a Jewish refugee to the Philippines headed its assessment team.  ”For me it was like coming full circle and I couldn’t help but think of what it must have been like when my grandparents and mother arrived 76 years ago” he said. ”My going to the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan was very special. I was repaying a debt to the country that saved my family.”"~f574c0ce8bdc33875238b4929a122fe377b91b86
6" (CNN) Playing catch with his dad in the back garden Alasdair Howell might appear like any other    boy.  But the hands he is using to throw the ball could one day be worth millions.  The child prodigy began playing piano aged three was performing at London’s prestigious Royal Festival Hall at six and now barely into   has been named by celebrity pianist Lang Lang as a future star.  ”It is a hobby but I like it very much and I think it’s part of me” says Howell who practices his craft for     to two hours each day. His public performances began before he could easily reach the piano stool but his composure at the keyboard made a lasting impression on the audience    and Lang.  ”I saw this little baby sitting on the piano he had hair almost like Chopin’s. He played for me he was very young. .. and I thought this is a cute boy and has some potential” said Lang. Howell’s future lies literally in his own hands    and that means taking care of them even when playing in the garden.  ”We’ve not talked about insuring them” said Alasdair’s father Richard. ”I don’t know how practical that will be but I certainly worry about them.”  ”We’ve been ice skating a few times and that just terrifies me I do worry about his hands and telling him he can’t become a wicket keeper on cricket he has to be careful with his hands.”  And it’s not just his hands that are feeling the pressure there are other side effects of being a child star.  ”Once you’re child prodigy that means your parents and your teacher will probably put more attention on you than some other kid” explains Lang.  ”When you get a lot of attention it’s a good thing but it also creates the pressure.”  Lang Lang has become a global superstar through a combination of his breathtaking talent and flamboyant personality.  He is one of the few classical artists today who can frequently pack out concert halls around the world performing for presidents prime ministers and a global audience at the Beijing Olympics.  What has become known as the ”Lang Lang effect” inspired millions of Chinese children to take up the piano.  He harbors a passion to pass on his enthusiasm for the instrument and its music to a younger generation through his work as a UNICEF ambassador and his own music foundation. ”When I see those kids playing on stage or in the class I  become emotional because it really takes me back. I really want to help them to achieve their dreams because I know we had the same dream before.” Young musicians such as Alasdair are underpinning record industry hopes that classical music will defy the pessimists and ensure a bright future for this rich musical heritage.  ”I think how far Alasdair goes is really going to be up to Alasdair” says his father Richard. ”There’s only so much we can do to support him and he’s 10 now as Lang Lang said between the ages of 10 and 20 is vital for any musician’s development.”  Watch: The rise of Soweto’s string playing stars Listen: How classical music is making a comeback"~45b747deefb7b079464ec123b03c1fe1cd523531

Since it was first released on July 3 1985 Back to the Future has become one of the most profitable    and beloved    film trilogies of all time spawning a cartoon series upcoming theater show and countless hovercraft prototypes. Over three decades later the films appear to have lost none of their appeal with tens of thousands of fans kitting out in their best Marty McFly vests and Doc radiation suits for Secret Cinema’s Back to the Future screening at London’s Olympic Park last year. ”Back to the Future remains popular today because it is a perfectly constructed film born out of a fresh and creative idea” says Caseen Gaines author of ’We Don’t Need Roads: The Making of the Back to the Future Trilogy.’ ”The filmmakers were at the top of their game and that shows in every frame of the film.”   Indeed it feels fitting that a film about time travel has managed to stand the test of well time. ”It visually presents the theoretical complexities of time travel    and its consequences    through comedy and warmth with excellent examples of   and ” says Dr. Sorcha Ní Fhlainn lecturer in Film Studies and American Literature at Manchester Metropolitan University who helped put together this very quiz.  ”It is also important because it articulates so much about 1980s culture    Reaganism upward mobility the seemingly limitless potential and perils of science and discovery. It updates and modifies the brilliance of H. G Wells’ 1895 novella ’The Time Machine’ in exciting and culturally specific ways” added the author of ”The Worlds of Back to the Future: Critical Essays on the Films.” Like many fans Ni Fhlainn’s devotion runs deep. ”I first saw it on VHS in 1986    it was a film my family watched repeatedly as I grew up and gave me a lifelong love of 1980s American culture and that irresistible dream of time travel that we consistently revisit in science fiction cinema” she said. And in true ”Back to the Future” spirit if you don’t nail all the questions in the quiz the first time you could always go back and do it again."~77fa5b819c86e93d4ec1d96899d61c5b9ed52d0e
" (CNN) Two years ago Aaron Hernandez had a $40 million contract and was a rising NFL star. Now the former New England Patriot is on trial in the killing of Odin Lloyd. Lloyd a semipro football player was shot multiple times on June 17 2013. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty. Here are some of the key moments from the past week of his murder trial: Victim’s sister can talk about the texts Judge Susan Garsh on Monday reversed her initial ruling to block any mention of multiple texts from Lloyd before he was slain. Lloyd’s sister Shaquilla Thibou will be able to say she received four texts from her brother just minutes before his death.   The last text came at 3:23 a. m. a minute before workers in the industrial park where Lloyd’s body later was found heard gunshots.  Thibou had been expected to testify Friday but that testimony was delayed as the court proceedings focused instead on exploring critical cellphone records. Thibou will not be able to talk about the nature of the texts including this one that prosecutors say was from Lloyd: ”U saw who I’m with. .. Nfl. .. just so u know.” The judge ruled it would be too prejudicial against Hernandez.  Gunshots ’like fireworks going off’ Two plant employees working the overnight shift at Needletech Products Inc. a company in the industrial park where Lloyd’s body was found reported hearing loud bangs at the time he was thought to have been fatally shot. One worker Barbara Chan said she was napping in her car during her lunch break between 3 and 3:30 a. m.  ”I heard a loud band maybe four or five times” she testified Monday saying she thought it was fireworks.  ”It was two slow ones and three fast ones” she added. Another plant worker Michael Ribeiro said he heard about six or eight loud bangs just after 3:20 a. m.  ”A loud banging sound like fireworks going off” Ribeiro testified. Prosecutors have presented evidence including autopsy photos that show Lloyd was shot six times    once in the back once in the arm and the rest to his torso. What does the surveillance video show? On Tuesday during testimony by one of three cleaning ladies in the Hernandez household prosecutors showed the jury video of Hernandez’s fiancée Shayanna Jenkins taking a trash bag from the house and placing it in the trunk of her sister’s car.  Her sister Shaneah Jenkins was Lloyd’s girlfriend. What might Shayanna Jenkins say? In the video Shayanna Jenkins appears to walk out the back patio door of the Hernandez home carrying a heavy black trash bag. At one point she puts it down and places a pile of clothes into the bag picks it up again and goes to the garage.  One of the maids Carla Barbosa then moves a white van out of the way to clear a path for Jenkins. Jenkins then puts the bag into the trunk of her sister’s car.     Prosecutors allege Jenkins may have been following instructions from Hernandez to get rid of the murder weapon from their home by putting the gun in a black trash bag and borrowing her sister’s car to dispose of the bag in a trash bin.   Prosecutors say that on the day after Lloyd was killed Jenkins got a coded text message from Hernandez. Hernandez asked Jenkins to get something out of their basement according to search warrants.     ”Go . .. in back of the screen in movie room when u (sic) get home an (sic) there is a box . .. jus (sic) in case u were looking for it! !! Member (sic) how you ruined the big tv . .. WAS JUST THINKIN bout that lol wink wink love u TTYL. ...K”     TTYL is shorthand for ”talk to you later.”    When Jenkins returned home she was captured on the same security system but without the bag. Jenkins told a grand jury she threw it in a trash bin but couldn’t remember where according to prosecutors. Prosecutors suspect the   murder weapon was inside.   (Jenkins has been granted immunity compelling her to testify at Hernandez’s trial. She is on the prosecution’s witness list. It is not known whether her testimony will help or hurt Hernandez.) When the defense team questioned Barbosa she acknowledged she had no idea what was in the trash bag and that it could have been trash. Housekeepers testify about guns Two other cleaning ladies Marilia Prinholato and Grazielli Andrade Silva both testified this week they found guns in the Hernandez home. Silva owns the company responsible for Hernandez’s residence and has also cleaned other Patriots’ players houses  Silva testified she took a gun from a pair of Hernandez’s pants and showed it to her  . She said she put it back in the pants because she didn’t want anyone to know she had seen it.  Silva also testified to feeling a gun under the mattress in the basement bedroom where Ernest Wallace was staying. Wallace and Carlos Ortiz have also been charged with murder in the death of Lloyd. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. Prinholato said she saw a gun fall out from beneath the mattress of the same bed a month before Lloyd’s killing. Video shows Hernandez dancing shortly before Lloyd’s death Surveillance video shows Hernandez pulling up to a gas station in his rented silver Nissan Altima at 2 a. m. that June 17 a little more than an hour before Lloyd’s death. Wallace and Ortiz are with him.  The surveillance video was shown in court this week.   Hernandez and Ortiz exit the car. Ortiz is wearing a white towel which prosecutors say is the same one found at the crime scene. Hernandez dances a few times    once as he walks in front of his car and into the store where he and Ortiz buy cotton   bubble gum and a box of Black  Mild cigars. A chewed piece of gum was found stuck to a .  shelling in a trash bin at an Enterprise rental car place a detective said.   Surveillance video shows Hernandez dancing again pumping his arms in the air as he returns to his car and walks around. The three men leave the gas station at 2:12 a. m. Twenty minutes later at 2:32 a. m. another surveillance video shows a silver Nissan Altima pull up in front of Lloyd’s house.  Lloyd is waiting outside and gets in the car."~9542e7e488b07c77ade702356de06008e625d012
" (CNN) In South London a   wax house is melting. In the city’s busy Covent Garden shopping piazza a building floated above the ground. A   walk away a townhouse is flipped on its head.  No you’re not hallucinating. These are the most recent irreverent installations from Alex Chinneck the British artist making a name for himself with   works that appeal to the imagination and beg for a  . For the past year he’s been achieving this through architecture.  ”Architecture is the fabric and surroundings of our daily and habitual environments” says Chinneck 30. ”It provides a very good canvas for creative exploration and abstraction.”  An architectural chapter  When I meet with Chinneck at his psychiatric    in Hackney (seriously) Take My Lighting But Don’t Steal my Thunder    the polystyrene building floating above Covent Garden    has just been taken down after its   run.  ”It was on the national news in 24 countries that piece and footfall was up 18 percent in respect to trade and the piazza. So that’s just great” he says.  Read: 10 works of art that shocked the world The floating building is part of what Chinneck calls the ”architectural chapter” of his career which has born four   installations that use the materials language and shapes associated with the craft. Though he’d previously used construction materials to create small sculptures he only recently started working on a larger scale partly inspired by Rachel Whiteread’s House (a concrete mold of a Victorian house that won the Turner Prize in 1993) and the installations of Richard Wilson. ”It just made sense to integrate those creative explorations into an architectural context and scale back to where they belonged.”  Making the familiar strange  What makes Chinneck’s work distinctive    other than its obvious   properties    is how each one seems both at home and out of place in its surrounding neighborhood. A Pound of Flesh for 50p built in Southwark as part of Merge Festival would look like a typical Georgian house were it not made of wax and melting a little more each day. The floating building looks like a part of the    market has just been plucked and suspended in mid air.   Read: The dazzling symmetry of Iran’s mosques ”I don’t like to disrupt a district too much so the work is contextually sensitive. The material and visual decisions are informed by the district and the area and the architectural language of that region” he explains. ”The concepts are extremely considered despite their playfulness and simplicity. They’re tailored to their environment and their audience.”  His installation in Covent Garden for example needed to speak to the piazza’s high levels or foot traffic and tourists to please the commissioning landlords.  ”The demographic through the piazza is incredibly eclectic but it’s very   and recreational. People come and go take a photo and move on so the artwork had to deliver an impact for the Instagram generation.” This last phrase seems to sum up his installations well. The pieces are difficult to execute simple to enjoy and he insists free of any particular meaning or concept. The priority is public enjoyment. Conceptually light sculpturally complex  The response to the floating house as well as his other works has been overwhelmingly positive. Along with comments   Chinneck says he regularly receives emails tweets and links to articles from people who have enjoyed his installations. The owner of a vintage shop near From the Knees of My Nose to the Belly of my Toes his sliding house in the seaside town of Margate even gifted him a free suit because of the number of shoppers his installation attracted.  Read: The surreal architecture you wish existed Though he tries to avoid the usual traps    internet comment sections namely    Chinneck still receives his share of negative criticism too. He’s grown immune to accusations that his work is pointless a waste of taxpayers’ money or alternately a waste of private commissioners’ money but he’s still occasionally frustrated by the assumption that his work is easy or banal because of its simplicity and lack of intellectual intent.   ”I don’t understand at what point the experience needed this intellectual justification to be an important and valuable one” he says. ”I’m often criticized for this lack of conceptual content. But what we lose in conceptual content we make up for in structural and sculptural complexity.” (To wit: The floating house took eight months to realize and had over 100 people involved from design to construction The melting house    which was commissioned designed and constructed concurrently    required about 75 people to take care of wax fabrication carpentry steelwork painting and  .)  Read: Is this the end of ambitious Chinese architecture? ”With art and I think really a lot of public art you create it and then you have to abandon it a little bit distance yourself from it because it’s not really yours anymore” he says. ”There’s no safe place in the public eye.” Creating a legacy  With the melting house now a pile of hardened goo being scraped off a pebbled lot (the installation finished Sunday) and the floating building broken down and hauled away Chinneck is focusing on the future. He’s currently investigating how to tie the Tate Modern’s distinctive chimney into a knot and developing a windmill that has fallen from its base causing the building to spin while the sails remain stuck in the ground efforts he suspects could trump his past projects in size and ambition.  ”I’m kind of bored by the last and excited by the next which is a healthy attitude” he says. ”I think it encourages progress.” The greatest buildings you’ll never see: Priceless monuments lost in conflict Art works that mess with your sense of scale ’Avant gardens’: When art design and a whole load of plants collide The most spectacular buildings of 2014"~b9225e2251daf527a6f510e41f50f297a77364c0
" (CNN) Emily Blincoe’s Instagram feed is a virtual haven for neat freaks everywhere.   Scroll through and you’ll find image after satisfying image of food plants and household goods arranged in a tidy   manner that suggests either an artist’s eye or a latent psychological disorder.  The   photographer is a master of what has come to be known as ”organization porn” stylized images of everyday objects stacked laid and arranged in a neat visually pleasing way.  These images have risen to viral prominence on sharing platforms like Reddit Pinterest and Tumblr as well as social media networks like Instagram.  Since Blincoe started her   Arrangements series in 2011 she has built her name    and an Instagram following of over 330 000    off this aesthetic. Though it started as a personal project she’s since created similar images for Gap Target and eBay. ”You could take a photo of a bouquet of flowers or you could spend five hours clipping the tops and arranging them by gradient” she says. ”It’s just a different way of looking at something that other people aren’t willing to put in the time for.” But why are these images so popular among the neat and messy alike? Psychologists may have the answer.  Balancing order and chaos  According to Johan Wagemans an experimental psychologist specializing in visual perception at Belgium’s University of Leuven these images are fundamentally different from the stimuli the brain ordinarily gets.  Though the individual components depicted are familiar the new context requires that the viewer look for more than just literal meaning in the image much like abstract art.  ”It’s the fascination of the image being something different than a messenger of meaning” he explains. ”Whenever we see things in our environment or when we look at images the brain is organizing the inputs or trying to make sense of them. Usually perception is after meaning but when you start playing with images in a way like this it’s clear that it’s not about meaning it’s about the special relationship between things and how they form a group or a composition.” A typical naturally occurring composition    say leaves on a tree    does not merit a second look because it is both conventional and chaotic. A heap of leaves is uninteresting for the same reason. ”Suddenly there’s a structure or a composition on a higher level by arranging objects in a specific way” he says. ”The combination between things that are very familiar and boring in themselves but are suddenly subject to a new organization creates something that wasn’t there in the beginning.” Indeed this is what initially attracted   designer Austin Radcliffe to this style of image. As curator of Things Organized Neatly a popular blog and   source for these   images he’s seen thousands. ”What I like about it is visual interest and the ways in which the objects relate to each other when you put them together. They can tell a story or draw comparisons or at the very least make things look nice together” he says.   Radcliffe first started curating images in 2010 inspired by the gridded layouts designers used to organize their work and the concept of ”knolling” popularized by artist Tom Sachs. (Radcliffe would go on to intern for Sachs in 2012.)  Since then he’s amassed more than 350 000 blog followers spoken at the Tate Modern and Tate Britain art museums in London and signed a deal for a book with Universe Publishing an imprint of Rizzoli due for release in 2016. Calmness and clarity  But for many of Radcliffe’s followers the appreciation goes beyond the aesthetic.  ”I hear that a lot people go to my website to calm down or to take a break or relax or procrastinate” he says.  ”I think there’s a calmness and sort of clarity to see everything that’s been neatly laid out and clutter’s been erased. It’s just a very peaceful serene way of organizing objects.”  Kathleen Vohs a marketing professor at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota isn’t surprised by this reaction.  ”Clutter is very stressful on people’s psychology and there have been a number of studies that have looked at what clutter does to people’s minds and from that we can take the perspective that things that are tightly organized are going to have the opposite effect” says Vohs.  Her own research published in the   journal Psychological Science supports that claim. After having participants work in either a tidy or cluttered environment researchers observed that tidy environments encouraged participants to ”follow norms and stick to the rules.”  ”People find   to be comforting because they know exactly what to do and not a lot of decisions have to be made” she says.  ”If people are perhaps stressed out or somewhat exhausted from their normal everyday lives looking at a   environment a   environment could give that sense of calm or release because it sort of suggests that all you have to do is follow the rules and everything will be okay.” Photographer Blincoe agrees suggesting that the images are as calming to create as they are to consume. ”I’m not so particular in my personal life you know. My house isn’t arranged by color everything isn’t in place at all times. But I think it’s a good little kind of retreat for me to present these items in a visually appealing way” she says.  ”It’s not something that I set up like ’Oh thank god I got that out of me’ but you know it’s definitely a part of what I love to do.”"~e477847a6da8738659449e2e42ed9086ba003d2a
" (CNN) From the moment we are born the first question our parents are asked is ”Is it a boy or a girl?”  The answer to that seemingly simple question quickly establishes the child’s path and trajectory for years to come however the question is not simple. The question is tragically flawed and here’s a newsflash for everyone who has ever asked new parents that question: You’re asking the wrong people.  I realize that parents are simply sharing a bit of biological information based on their baby’s physical ”parts” but only that beautiful baby can accurately and authentically tell you what gender he or she is. You may want to give it a little time before you paint that nursery bright pink or pick out junior’s first baseball glove    it’s just not that simple. I may only be 15 years old and will be the first to admit that I know very little about this great big world but I know way too much about gender and being mislabeled.  Why transgender teen Jazz Jennings is everywhere You see the doctor told my parents ”It’s a girl” but he couldn’t have been more wrong. Aside from my biology I knew I was a boy from the age of 2. I was 100% sure of who I was and biology was an insignificant part of the conversation.  Keep in mind that this was a time before I had even realized that being a boy trapped in a girl’s body was anything beyond normal and this was long before I could possibly articulate what was happening.  However there was no need to articulate anything. I was a little boy expressing myself based on what was in my heart and mind    not yet distorted by biology other people’s confusion or fear.  It was when I was older that other people let me know something was ”off.” No matter how many times I was told differently I was a boy and the people that mattered knew it too for the most part.  I want to address the moment where people gender and respectful communication part ways. That is the moment when the word ”sexuality” creeps into the conversation. That is when people get scared cite religion start whispering and disconnect.  It’s a sad moment but I get it.  People have always mocked what they don’t understand and this is a tough one for most to grasp. That said it has to change and I believe it is changing.  The transgender life: What to know say and understand I cannot stress to the world enough gender and sexuality are two completely different things and the moment people incorrectly connect them is the moment when most people start looking for an exit or a fight.  Save your fear people. This is not something to be afraid of it’s an opportunity for us to evolve.  Nothing is completely black or white hot or cold here or there or male and female there are varying degrees of everything and the quicker we respect that the faster we all grow and allow people to be who they are. It all starts by taking sexuality out of the initial conversation.  I first heard the term ”gay” in the second grade long after I had my first ”girlfriend” and had proudly written ”a penis” at the top of my Christmas list.  Not until after I learned that there was such a thing as sexuality and homosexuality did I become afraid of who I was.  It wasn’t until I learned that there were people out there that considered homosexuality ”abnormal” or that people needed to put labels on our feelings toward others that I became terrified that I was ”different.”  I knew I liked girls and I was technically a girl biologically but I was a boy and my feelings about girls were normal boy feelings. I was not gay    but try to explain that to someone without his or her eyes glazing over.  Thankfully I grew up in a household that taught me that I could love anybody I wanted to and it was fine because it is fine. Anyone can love anyone and there is nothing wrong with that. Fortunately people have developed more of an understanding of that over time but there are always going to be people that think differently and we all have to accept that. Do they matter? Of course they do because we all matter equally however ignorant people are here to help us learn how to better communicate everyone is reachable with the right circumstances and I look forward to the battles as much as the victories.  As long as you’re happy you’re indestructible. That said I knew being gay wasn’t a bad thing but I also knew it didn’t describe me. I was a straight boy who liked girls and there is nothing wrong with that either.  I was afraid of being thought of differently. The most crippling fear came from people not understanding that I was a boy trapped in a girl’s body and simply labeling me something I’m not. That’s what I was truly afraid of.  Discovering that I was transgender was a miraculous moment. I finally found the key that unlocked the cage I’d been trapped in for 14 years and that’s why I call this journey ”My Transcension.” With the support of my parents I am sharing my story. Breaking free and owning your sexuality is something you find within yourself and is spectacular but it is just the tiniest part of the greater transgender conversation. I am going beyond that and my journey is one that is constantly moving forward and upward.  I’m taking the body I was born into and transforming it into the body I know I’m supposed to be in    thanks to my family friends Dr. Jo Olson the support groups the science and lastly myself.  See that’s the irony I was the first person and truly the only person capable of answering the ”is it a boy or girl” question    not the doctor my parents or anyone who thinks they know better.  That is the lesson let each of us dictate our own path and respect everyone’s choice. I realize that it’s easier said than done but if you read this and find yourself open to a new conversation about gender I consider that a win for us all.  Truthfully I’m most proud of myself for having the courage to find my own way and owning it to proudly begin my transcencion from someone I wasn’t    into the man I always knew I’d become.  Whether I’m a boy or a girl white or black rich or poor gay or straight it’s completely irrelevant. What truly matters is the fact that I’m Avery Wallace and I’ve always known exactly who I was. I’m here to share my journey and hopefully help someone else recognize theirs."~05ad56400b8bb5a544334800e3f330b24766f158
"Washington (CNN) In a rare joint action with attorneys general for each of the 50 states the Federal Trade Commission says four cancer charities run by extended members of the same family conned donors out of $187 million from 2008 through 2012 and spent almost nothing to help actual cancer patients. Each of the charities charged were the subject of extensive reporting by CNN in 2013.  And in each instance none of the four charities would comment. We were ordered out of the building at the Cancer Fund of America in Knoxville Tennessee and were the object of an obscene gesture by the CEO of The Breast Cancer Society in Mesa Arizona. The Cancer Fund of America is run by James Reynolds Sr. His son James Reynolds Jr. is the CEO of the Breast Cancer Society. Another charity the Children’s Cancer Fund of America is run by Rose Perkins the   of the elder James Reynolds. He’s also the CEO of the fourth charity Cancer Support Services. The government says the charities claimed to provide direct support for cancer patients breast cancer patients and children with cancer. ”These were lies” the government’s complaint says. Jessica Rich chief of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection says that in all the charities spent about 97% of donations they received either on private fundraisers or on themselves. Only 3% she says went to help actual cancer patients. According to the complaint funds donated to help cancer patients instead went for personal use in often lavish ways. ”[D]onated funds were used to pay for vehicles personal consumer goods college tuition gym memberships Jet Ski outings dating website subscriptions luxury cruises and tickets to concerts and professional sporting events” the complaint says. ”Most of what we are doing is bringing actions against fraud” says Rich. ”And this is as about as bad as it can get: taking money away from cancer victims.” CNN Investigations: Hidden cameras reveal airport workers stealing There was also what the FTC calls ”rampant nepotism” at play in all of the charities. For instance at the Breast Cancer Society James Reynolds Jr. hired his wife Kristina Hixson to be his public relations manager. The complaint states that he also hired Hixson’s two sisters her son by a previous marriage her mother and her  . According to the complaint Hixson’s mother had been a caterer. At the Breast Cancer Society she was hired to write grant applications.  Moreover on their tax returns each charity claimed millions of dollars in donated goods shipped to overseas locations on behalf of cancer patients. The complaint says the charities never owned any of the goods in question and simply paid a fee to a private firm in South Carolina to ship the goods called   . CNN went to Guatemala in early 2014 to investigate anyone who may have received those gifts and could find no evidence that they even existed. As a result of the complaint two of the charities say they will close their doors. Both the Breast Cancer Society and the Children’s Cancer Fund of America are being dissolved according to the complaint. James Reynolds Jr. faces a judgment of more than $60 million in fines and Rose Perkins who runs the Children’s Cancer Fund of America faces a judgment of around $30 million.   Under a proposed final order the judgment against Reynolds Jr. will be suspended when he pays $75 000. The judgments against Children’s Cancer Fund of America will be partly met upon liquidation of its assets and the judgment against Perkins will be suspended due to her inability to pay.  CNN Investigations: Many airport workers not screened The FTC’s Jessica Rich however said there are few assets left. Government regulators will be lucky to recover $1 million she told CNN. As for James Reynolds Sr. he will contest the charges in the complaint the government says. CNN hasn’t yet been able to reach attorneys for Reynolds Sr. his son or Perkins for comment but in a message posted on the Breast Cancer Society website Reynolds Jr. said: ”While the organization its officers and directors have not been found guilty of any allegations of wrong doing and the government has not proven otherwise our Board of Directors has decided that it does not help those who we seek to serve and those who remain in need for us to engage in a highly publicized expensive and distracting legal battle around our fundraising practices.”"~299605a3d3ca8d03136f6f67230432fc0eab9ae5

" (CNN) My personal favorite is this. At the top of a page of angular medieval text    full of theological extrapolations and religious devotion    is a cartoon of a deadpan dog. ”It’s amazing to think that people doodled in medieval times in a similar way to how they doodle today” said Erik Kwakkel a book historian at Leiden University Holland.  ”When you see the monks expressing their personalities their sense of humor it makes you feel like you’re traveling back through time. It’s like you’re going through the keyhole and sitting right next to them.” Indeed that dog would not be out of place in ”The Simpsons.” The spacesuit inspired by medieval armor ’Medieval eye candy’ Kwakkel is making an unlikely name for himself on the internet by posting ”medieval eye candy” that he comes across during the course of his research. And the doodles are by far the most popular. ”Normally scribes would doodle or write snatches of lettering after cutting their nibs to make sure they were the correct width” he said. ”These   ranged from the sort of scribbled lines that people still do today to words names full sentences or simple drawings. Sometimes we even find pretty good drawings.” These include funny faces with long beards big hats or noses as well as animals unidentifiable creatures and even caricatures of teachers and colleagues.  In the majority of cases the doodles were never intended to be seen. They were drawn on the outside of the first and last pages of a book which were later glued to wooden covers. But although the glue has obliterated a great many doodles and   a variety has survived the test of time. ”They offer a rare glimpse into the informal or private world of medieval monks” Kwakkel said.  ”Personally I love the thumbprint which was left by a careless scribe who spilled ink on his work. It seems so fresh and human yet it happened 700 years ago.” World’s coolest bookstores Hidden meanings For modern scholars doodles and   can be more than mere curiosities.  When the scribes were trying out their quills they often wrote in their own handwriting rather than the heavily prescriptive styles demanded by their work. This allows academics like Kwakkel to identify individual scribes    who were rarely credited for their work    and track their careers including when they migrated across Europe. Sometimes they can also tell us about the classroom environment. ”I found one that is obviously a drawing of the face of a schoolmaster. You can recognize him from the teacher’s hat on his head” Kwakkel said. ”It was obviously drawn by a student in class seven centuries ago.” Some may have had a deeper meaning at the time too particularly the ones in the margins of the text (known technically as ”marginalia”).  One common trope was a drawing of a person’s profile with a long pointed nose. Kwakkel believes that this was intended to highlight a particularly important sentence as indicated by the end of the nose. Another example shows a snatch of musical notes together with the lyrics of a hymn. The monk was probably trying to remind himself of a song this Kwakkel says is ”one of the earliest example of musical notation that we have.” Ancient book bound with human skin Treasure troves of secret manuscripts But the aspect of his work that most excites Kwakkel is the uncovering of fragments of ancient texts which he describes as ”treasure troves” or ”stowaways.” ”After Gutenburg invented the printing press in 1436 the old handwritten manuscripts fell out of fashion. Some were thrown away but others were chopped up and used in bindings and covers” he explained. ”I often take 15 students to a library for three days and we carefully open up the bindings of medieval books to reveal what is inside. ”We have found many fascinating rare manuscripts this way. It is magical like uncovering a time capsule.  ”I know there is a lot of stuff hidden out there in bindings waiting to be discovered but I can’t fathom what it might be.” His discoveries include the rough workings of medieval scholars who were translating texts from Arabic to Latin. Ordinarily only the finished copies survive so these manuscripts open up a new area of research into the translators’ methodology. But his favorite is a stash of 132 notes letters and receipts that came from the house of a German nobleman. One dated 31 May 1486 was a note to a servant. ”Could you please get me some wild roses but make sure to include some that are still in bud” it says. ”That was breathtaking” said Kwakkel. ”It was so casual and romantic. It as if it had been written just yesterday.” The future Underground: London’s new   tube trains Did artists eerily predict the Ukraine crisis? Would you eat Fukushima soup?

" (CNN) Eight thousand years ago a pencil mustache was tattooed onto the upper lip of a young Peruvian man. His mummified body has since become the oldest existing example of tattoo art on the planet. Today’s world is of course almost unrecognizable by comparison. But according to Professor Nicholas Thomas Director of the Museum of Archeology and Anthropology at Cambridge University    author of a new book about body art    the tattoo has made a powerful comeback. ”There has been an extraordinary epochal change in the last 25 years” he says. ”When I was a child in the 1960s we didn’t see tattoos everywhere. But there has been an explosion in popularity and this tells us a lot about who we are both culturally and as individuals.” In fact according to some studies up to 38% of Americans and a fifth of British adults have some type of   body art.  Many interlocking factors have a bearing on the popularity of the tattoo. Foremost among them is a change in the popular conception of the body. ”Because of advances in technology and medical science people no longer understand the body as something natural that you’re born with and live with. Instead we understand it much more as something that is changeable and mutable” says Professor Thomas. ”People have all sorts of surgical interventions medical and cosmetic. It is even possible to change your gender. This means that we now see our body as something we have a responsibility to design and make. Even something as simple as a fitness routine or a tan indicates this attitude.” Read: Society isn’t quite ready for facial tattoos A permanent stamp of identity In addition as global mobility leads to the increasing pluralization of society identity is also being seen as something to be designed rather than inherited. ”People are no longer simply British or Australian or Californian” he says. ”Our identities are far more particular linked to our interests affinities to cultural or spiritual traditions tastes in music and subcultural allegiances. The tattoo has become a vehicle for that sort of particular identification.” The recent surge in popularity for tattooing started in the California   scene of the Sixties and Seventies. During the 20th Century tattoos had become associated with criminals sailors and members of the military who had become dislocated from mainstream society and wanted to stamp a commemoration of that experience on their bodies. The Californians took that trend and subverted it inventing their own designs and viewing body ink as an art form rather than a type of social branding. More recently there’s been a return to traditional forms of tribal tattoos. Ancient Celtic designs or those originating in the Pacific Islands provide inspiration for a great number of body ink enthusiasts (although it remains unusual to see a young man with a tattoo of a pencil mustache). In the past however tattoos were not used to form individual identities. Instead they tended to be a collective cultural project constituting particular social markers. Sometimes they created a spectacular appearance when a tribe all shared the same design in other instances they were used as initiation or    rites. ”In Samoa men have elaborate tattoos inked on their thighs buttocks and lower chest” says Professor Thomas. ”It is a painful ordeal that requires a man to submit to the authority of the elders. When he emerges he is celebrated as a hero.” Read: Tattoos and piercings: How young is too young? Tattoos and individualism The Samoans and many other traditional communities saw having a tattoo as an important process rather than a possession. The whole body was tattooed at once and it was rarely supplemented. By contrast the modern tattoo enthusiast tends to view them as an expanding collection that creates permanent markers of important moments in an individual’s life. ”Globalization is exposing us to a whole range of traditions from many places” Professor Thomas says. ”Body art is becoming the opposite of conformity a sort of badge of travel or internationalism. People visit places and make them parts of themselves so that they will forever bear marks of their unique visit.” As Jonny Depp once put it ”My body is my journal and my tattoos are my story”. But does this indicate an underlying cultural anxiety? Are we literally growing less comfortable in our own skin? ”That’s part of it” says Professor Thomas. ”As the world opens up culturally and economically there are fewer certainties than there ever were before and far more multiplicity. So people are trying to invent themselves and make it permanent.” Often he continues people who feel that a spiritual dimension is missing in contemporary Western life may be attracted to the spiritual symbols of traditional cultures around the world which are often ”understood naively in terms of spirituality”. Read: Suffering from ’tattoo regret’ The Christian approach towards tattoos The decline of Christianity in the West has also had a degree of influence on the rise of the tattoo. Some streams of Christianity have condemned body art due to the perceived sanctity of the body. But this is far from universal. During the Renaissance for example European devotees who went on pilgrimage to the Holy Land often had tattoos of Christian symbols or scenes to commemorate the experience. Many were carried out by the Razzouk family in the Old City of Jerusalem (members of that family are still carrying out the service today). But whatever your type of tattoo research has shown that it profoundly alters the way in which you will be perceived. Adults with tattoos have been shown to be more sexually active to engage in riskier behavior and to have stronger   and   though this sharply declined in women three weeks after the tattoo. Moreover academic studies of first impressions of people with tattoos have revealed that they were expected to have had more sexual partners be less inhibited and to be probable  . Whether tattoos are the cause or the effect of such personality types is a moot point. But one thing is certain: given that the fragmentation and diversification of modern life shows no sign of reducing body art is going to be here to stay.

"Honolulu Hawaii (CNN) The United States is hitting North Korea with a new set of economic sanctions after determining the country was behind last month’s computer hack at Sony.   The White House said a new executive order targets leaders in North Korea’s government preventing them from accessing property and entering the United States. The isolated nuclear regime which has denied involvement in the Sony hack was already subject to a strict set of U. S. economic restrictions.   The Federal Bureau of Investigation has maintained North Korea was behind the broad computer breach at Sony despite evidence that some technology experts said points instead to former employees of the studio. On Friday officials said the new set of sanctions was further indication of their confidence in North Korea’s culpability and said that private tech firms aren’t privy to the intelligence proving Pyongyang’s guilt.       President Barack Obama signed the executive order putting the new sanctions in place on the    day of his winter vacation in Hawaii. Before his vacation began in   Obama said North Korea was responsible for the attack and the United States was preparing a response. The White House said Friday’s announcement reflected the beginning of that response. RELATED: Obama says North Korea’s hack not war but ’cybervandalism’ ”The order is not targeted at the people of North Korea but rather is aimed at the government of North Korea and its activities that threaten the United States and others” Obama wrote in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner.     The country poses a ”continuing threat to the national security foreign policy and economy of the United States” Obama wrote.       Among the agencies targeted by the new sanctions Friday was the Reconnaissance General Bureau an intelligence agency the United States said was responsible for ”major cyberoperations” in North Korea.       The new sanctions also target officials at North Korea’s Mining Development Trading Corporation which the United States says is responsible for the country’s arms dealing and weapons export business.     Seven officials who represent North Korea’s arms dealing trade in Africa Iran Russia and Syria were designated by the U. S. Treasury as subject to the new economic sanctions. U. S. administration officials said the individuals targeted by Friday’s sanctions are not thought to be responsible for the Sony hack. But in exposing their names and positions as North Korean arms dealers the United States hopes to stymie their business prospects. Their names were not publicly known until now. U. S. officials said they didn’t know whether the 10 North Korean officials listed by the Treasury Department held any assets in U. S. institutions. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the sanctions were meant to ”isolate key North Korean entities and disrupt the activities of close to a dozen critical North Korean operatives.” ”We will continue to use this broad and powerful tool to expose the activities of North Korean government officials and entities” Lew said. RELATED: North Korea lambasts U. S. over ’The Interview’ says Obama is the ’culprit’ Speaking to CNN late last month Obama said the United States would respond to the Sony hacking ”proportionately” without specifying what actions his government might take to punish Kim Jong Un’s government for its role in the attack.      Josh Earnest the White House press secretary said on Friday ”Today’s actions are the first aspect of our response.” That seemed to indicate the widespread Internet outages reported in North Korea last week were not a retaliatory response to the Sony hack though administration officials would not confirm the blackout came at the hands of the United States. ”There are many possible explanations for (North Korea’s) Internet outage including the possibility that they had ended up doing it to themselves” one U. S. official said."~ea96811ff3a467eecf540981857d9079de9e3944
" (CNN) The Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints which is the largest sponsor of Boy Scout troops in the United States says the church has strong measures in place to prevent the sexual abuse of scouts as claims have been made it hasn’t done enough. In the first interview about allegations of abuse in Mormon   scouting troops Church Elder L. Whitney Clayton told CNN that the church is at the forefront for prevention of child abuse. ”We feel like there is really no other organization that we know of    a church or something like a church    that does as much as we do” Clayton said. ”We have a zero tolerance policy or position with respect to child abuse and we train our people we teach our people we work with leaders we provide materials online and in hard copy.” Over several months CNN examined allegations of abuse that were detailed in at least five lawsuits filed against the church and the scouts.  But Clayton said the church today is proactive even constructing its buildings ”in such a way as to try to avoid any situation where child abuse could occur.” ”For instance if you walk down the hallway in an LDS chapel a Mormon church and look at the Sunday school classes you’re going to see windows in the doorways into those Sunday school classes so people can look inside and walk by” he said. The interview with Clayton followed a CNN investigation into the case of Melvin Novak who was sexually abused by his scoutmaster a member of the Mormon Church beginning when he was 14 years old in 1998 according to the lawsuit Novak filed against the church and the Boy Scouts of America. The scoutmaster Vance Hein had been forced in resign from scouting in the early 1990s after reports surfaced that he failed to report a fellow scoutmaster who was engaged in homosexual activities. That scoutmaster ended up going to prison for sexual assaults on minors. Hein’s name was added to the Boy Scouts of America’s ineligible volunteer files which are widely known as the ”perversion files.” The documents which were made public in 2012 are lists of scout leaders suspected of sexual abuse or homosexual activity. However three years after being kicked out of scouting Hein was allowed to rejoin the scouts after getting letters of recommendation attesting to his character. One of those letters was from Hein’s influential Mormon Bishop Jack Moyer who wrote that Hein was ”highly respected and liked.” Moyer who is now retired declined to speak to CNN. But in a deposition taken as part of the lawsuit last year he acknowledged that he would not have written the letter knowing what he later found out about Hein. The lawsuit charged that Hein ”actively groomed young boys under his charge for later sexual molestation.” Hein eventually was convicted of molesting Novak. He is now in prison for violating probation in the Novak case. Ken Rothweiler who is Novak’s lawyer said what happened in the case is outrageous. ”This case is probably the most egregious of all of the cases against the LDS church and the reason I say that is because the LDS church knew that Vance Hein this pedophile was already kicked out of scouting by the Boy Scouts of America” Rothweiler said. However church attorney David Pittinsky said it was the Boy Scouts organization that should have done something. ”If the Boy Scouts had disclosed to Bishop Moyer the information they had in their files there is no way that Vance Hein would have ever become a scoutmaster and he would have been subject to excommunication by the church” Pittinsky said. In a statement to CNN the Boy Scouts of America said Hein was removed from scouting ”for reasons unrelated to child abuse.” The group added ”Our efforts to protect youth were plainly insufficient inappropriate or wrong. We extend our deepest apologies to victims and their families.” Read the full response from the Boy Scouts The case ended last year with a confidential settlement paid to Novak who is now 31. All but one of the five lawsuits filed against the church and Boy Scouts of America have been settled. Hein was sentenced to probation in 2000 after pleading guilty to indecently assaulting Novak. While on probation he was arrested for possession of child pornography and was sentenced in 2012 to 15 to 30 years in prison. ”Any case is alarming to me. It’s a tragedy” Clayton said. ”I’m a father. I have seven children four boys and three girls. I have 19 grandchildren. The thought of one of them as a child or youth being abused is absolutely horrific to me.”  Asked what he would say to Novak Clayton said ”I say to him and anyone else who has been abused in the church or other churches    I’m sorry that you’ve gone through what you’ve gone through. It’s a horrible thing for anyone to be abused. No child no youth should ever have to go through that.”"~66260914ffa73f05012c50c7dfe7533cd2c21ed8
" (CNN) Mountaineers have returned to Mount Everest for this year’s climbing season resuming the quest to summit the world’s highest peak after a deadly season last year.  In 2014 the Nepal climbing season ended after a piece of glacial ice fell unleashing an avalanche that killed 16 Nepalis who had just finished their morning prayers. The April 18 accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on Mount Everest. The deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the Sherpas and the dangers of climbing Everest.  In order to reduce risks the route through Khumbu Icefall the notoriously treacherous path where the 16 were killed has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer. ”They’re going in the icefall and as we found out on April 18 it’s the most dangerous place” said Conrad Anker a veteran climber who has been to Everest three times. ”They’re exposed to the tumbling ice hanging seracs above it. It’s very very dangerous. It’s the most dangerous place I’ve been in the mountains.”  At this point in the season climbing teams have not yet entered Khumbu Icefall which is essentially a frozen river rapid with jagged pieces breaking off and moving.  Nepal has issued 347 permits this year to climb Mount Everest with 125 of them from the previously shortened season according to the Nepal Ministry of Tourism.  It’s a slight increase from the 334 who were given permission last year.  The new path  The local Nepalese committee that determines the path up Everest announced in February that a different route had been selected. The climbers will now take a central route through the Khumbu Icefall avoiding the area where the deaths occurred. The committee comprised of Sherpas voted to return to the central route for safety reasons. ”There will be little risk of avalanche than in the right or left” said Yangji Doma Sherpa the spokeswoman for the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee. The central route had been used in the 1990s but was abandoned in favor of a quicker route she said. The new path means climbers will have to cross more crevasses and use more vertical and horizontal ladders. The committee issued a recommendation that the weight of workers’ gear be limited to avoid overloading the ladders.  ”I think it will be an hour longer on the icefall” said Alan Arnette who is blogging from Everest base camp this season. ”I don’t think it will be game changer.” Skipping the icefall  But one company Alpenglow Expeditions said it would stop climbing from the Nepal side where the climbers have to go through the icefall in favor of the northern route from China.  ”We’ve seen it get progressively more dangerous over the last few years” said  Adrian Ballinger the company’s founder and CEO. ”We believe the risk is too great for our workers.”  According to the China Tibet Mountaineering Association 320 people have been registered to climb the northern route to Everest this year. That’s 136 more than last year.   The Chinese side of Everest has typically been less popular than its Nepal counterpart because of concerns of government closures. Some Everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain but it also doesn’t have an icefall. The increasing popularity of the northern route has caused concern amongst Nepali companies that climbers will divert to the Chinese side.  ”I can already see the shift with mountaineers I speak to” said Dawa Steven Sherpa who is based in Nepal. ”More people are going to go to Tibet than Nepal. Nepal needs the tourism far more than China does. China has incredible wealth of resources and Nepal does not.” Why they return to the mountains Leading expeditions is how Sherpas feed their families and send their children to school. Nepal depends heavily on tourism dollars. Many of the guides had to bury their friends after the accident last year and while they may be ready to return to the summit their families are not. Many of them are ”leaving behind nervous   wives and children” whose memories of what happened last year are fresh said Dawa Sherpa managing director of Asian Trekking.  ”They do say they don’t want to put them through that again” he said. ”They’re not fearful for their own lives it’s what they’re putting their family through.”  Several mountaineers are also returning this year.  One of them is Jon Reiter who spoke to CNN last year after the tragedy. When the icy avalanche thundered down Reiter was shoved behind an ice block by his Sherpa guide.  Reiter who is making his way to base camp this year could not be reached directly. But he explained why he’s heading back to Everest this year on his blog.  ”I can’t quite find the words to tell you why or what really pulls me back to the mountains” he wrote.  ”When we were in the midst of last year’s events it was hard to see the big picture. It was hard to remember that people die in the mountains but that it’s more rare than not. ”It was hard for me to remember that I’m not choosing between my life at home and dying in the mountains. I like to think it’s similar to surviving a plane crash or a major pile up on the freeway.”"~89534b7d10d9156c9e9e575351ea2367549a92ef
6"Hong Kong (CNN) The World Health Organization warned that the MERS outbreak in South Korea is likely to grow as the number of people under quarantine crept up to 1 369 on Wednesday.  The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed five new cases    increasing the number of people with the disease to 35. These new cases were contracted within hospitals.  So far three people have died after contracting the respiratory virus in South Korea the country’s Health Ministry said Thursday in the largest MERS outbreak outside Saudi Arabia.  The first case concerning a man who returned to South Korea after traveling to Saudi Arabia Qatar the UAE and Bahrain was reported on May 20. The person had not been ill during his travels according to the World Health Organization.  More than 900 schools have shut to prevent the spread of the virus according to South Korea’s education ministry.  The extent of the outbreak in South Korea has taken many by surprise    mainly because the virus has not been shown to spread easily between humans and the health care system in the country is considered to be sophisticated and modern.   South Korean President Park   acknowledged problems in the country’s early response earlier this week.  ”Initial reaction for new infectious diseases like MERS is very important but there were some insufficiency in the initial response including the judgment on its contagiousness” she said.  She convened an emergency MERS meeting on Wednesday. MERS is in the same family of viruses as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) as well as the common cold. However MERS does not spread easily between humans    as far as scientists know at this point. ”So far the virus has been circulating in humans for three years” said Dr. Leo Poon a virology expert at the School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong who worked on the SARS outbreak more than a decade ago. ”We found little transmission in human. We know there is    transmission but it’s not sustainable.” Then why is it spreading in South Korea?  Since MERS short for Middle East respiratory syndrome was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 international cases have largely been confined to travelers bringing the virus back to other countries and infecting one or two others. There have been deaths in countries like Oman Algeria and Malaysia    but none of them had additional infections to the extent of South Korea.  ”This is quite unusual. I think this is the only country apart from those in the Middle East that has such a number of cases” said Poon. ”It’s not entirely surprising. In the Middle East people in Saudi Arabia had hospital outbreaks where a few people got infected. It’s a similar situation at the moment.” In early 2013 23 MERS cases in eastern Saudi Arabia were linked to a single outbreak extending through four health care facilities.  Similarly the vast majority of the South Korean cases have been linked to infections from hospitals.  Another factor for the spread in South Korea could be the fact that family members often stay with patients in their hospital rooms to watch and care for their loved ones.  ”With the hospital culture here the family does a lot of the nursing. For general patients on the ward there are fewer nurses than we are accustomed to in the West” said Dr. John Linton of Yonsei University’s Severance Hospital in Seoul. ”They would have been in close proximity to other patients.” How did it start in South Korea?  The first patient a    man had traveled to four Middle Eastern countries before returning to South Korea on May 4. During his flight he did not have any symptoms.  As he started getting sick a week later the Korean sought treatment at two clinics and two hospitals    ”creating multiple opportunities for exposure among health care workers and other patients” according to the WHO. MERS was not suspected and health care workers did not treat the first patient in isolation.  As a result the MERS cases in South Korea span patients from several health care facilities. Health officials have not identified the hospitals but 22 of the current cases are related to those who were at what’s being called ”Facility B.” That hospital has closed voluntarily.  ”Given the number of clinics and hospitals that cared for the index case further cases can be expected” the WHO stated in a situation report on Wednesday. Some of the infected people occupied the same room as the first patient and others had been in the same ward for times ranging from five minutes to several hours according to the WHO.  How does MERS spread?  Concern about the virus is gripping many in South Korea with schools shutting and the increased use of face masks and hand sanitizers.  The virus acts like a cold and attacks the respiratory system the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. But symptoms which include fever and a cough are severe and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. MERS spreads from close contact with an ill person such as living or caring for them.  5 things to know about MERS About three to four out of every 10 people reported with MERS have died. But the people who died often had underlying medical conditions that made them more vulnerable.  The two patients who died in South Korea had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heavy asthma.  As of Wednesday there have been 1 179 confirmed cases of MERS reported to WHO since 2012 and at least 442 cases were fatal. Cases have been reported in 25 countries with China and South Korea joining the ranks only last month WHO said.  MERS has been linked to camels and it’s possible that some people became infected after coming into contact with camels but it’s not completely clear.  There are no vaccines and no cures.  To prevent MERS the CDC recommends everyday hygiene practices like   covering coughs and sneezes and avoiding personal contact with sick people.

" (CNN) Seventy years ago Anne Frank died of typhus in a Nazi concentration camp at the age of 15. Just two weeks after her supposed death on March 31 1945 the   concentration camp where she had been imprisoned was liberated    timing that showed how close the Jewish diarist had been to surviving the Holocaust.  But new research released by the Anne Frank House shows that Anne and her older sister Margot Frank died at least a month earlier than previously thought.  Researchers   archives of the Red Cross the International Training Service and the   Memorial along with testimonies of survivors. They concluded that Anne and Margot probably did not survive to March 1945    contradicting the date of death which had previously been determined by Dutch authorities.  Their journey after the annex In 1944 Anne and seven others hiding in the Amsterdam secret annex were arrested and sent to the    concentration camp. Anne Frank’s final entry That same year Anne and Margot were separated from their mother and sent away to work as slave labor at the   camp in Germany.  Days at the camp were filled with terror and dread witnesses said. The sisters stayed in a section of the overcrowded camp with no lighting little water and no latrine. They slept on   straw and violent storms shredded the tents according to the researchers. Like the other prisoners the sisters endured long hours at roll call.  Her classmate Nannette Blitz recalled seeing Anne there in December 1944: ”She was no more than a skeleton by then. She was wrapped in a blanket she couldn’t bear to wear her clothes anymore because they were crawling with lice.” Listen to Anne Frank’s friends describe her concentration camp experience Their final days As the Russians advanced further the   concentration camp became even more crowded bringing more disease. A deadly typhus outbreak caused thousands to die each day.  Typhus is an infectious disease caused by lice that breaks out in places with poor hygiene. The disease causes high fever chills and skin eruptions.  ”Because of the lice infesting the bedstraw and her clothes Anne was exposed to the main carrier of epidemic typhus for an extended period” museum researchers wrote.  They concluded that it’s unlikely the sisters survived until March because witnesses at the camp said the sisters both had symptoms before February 7.  ”Most deaths caused by typhus occur around twelve days after the first symptoms appear” wrote  authors Erika Prins and Gertjan Broek. The exact dates of death for Anne and Margot remain unclear. Margot died before Anne.  ”Anne never gave up hope” said Blitz her friend. ”She was absolutely convinced she would survive.” Her diary endures as one of the world’s most popular books.

3"Aberdeenshire Scotland (CNN) In an exclusive interview ahead of his U. S. tour    and ahead of his   wedding anniversary    Prince Charles paid tribute to the ”brilliant” way his wife Camilla Duchess of Cornwall has taken on the ”real real challenge” of defining her public role. Watch ”Spotlight: Charles and Camilla” Saturday at 7:30 p. m. ET  to get an inside look at the royal couple as they prepare for their joint visit to the U. S. ”It’s always marvelous to have somebody who you know you feel understands and wants to encourage. Although she certainly pokes fun if I get too serious about things. And all that helps” Prince Charles told CNN. The couple first visited the U. S. together as newlyweds in 2005 and Camilla was confronted by hardcore Princess Diana fans with abusive placards. Polls at the time found that between 57% and 73% of Brits opposed Charles’ new wife being known as queen. If you go back even further to 1997 the year Diana died an Ipsos MORI poll put it at 86%.  Reporter’s notebook: Interviewing the royal couple But there’s been a change in sentiment since they married. A new poll conducted by Comres for CNN found that only 35% now oppose Camilla being known as queen. Nearly one in four said they liked her more now than they did 10 years ago.  This coincides with a change in palace strategy    away from the aggressive spin machine of the 1990s to simply allowing Camilla to be herself. When she appears in public she’s either seen supporting her husband or promoting a set of causes she has a genuine connection with. Prince Charles praised how his wife has handled herself.   ”She’s done an enormous amount for the whole issue around osteoporosis which of course runs in her family” he said noting that Camilla’s mother and grandmother both suffered from the bone disease. He also points to other issues Camilla is associated with including literacy and preventing sexual violence.  The Duchess of Cornwall by sticking to what she knows and cares about is able to connect with the people she meets which doesn’t always come across on camera. When Charles and Camilla married in 2005 there was huge sensitivity around the legacy of Diana who was expected to be queen herself. With this in mind royal aides announced that Camilla would not use the title of Queen when Charles becomes King. Instead she would be known as Princess Consort. That still stands although the public of today looks less likely to oppose the title of Queen."~3dd95dea301e0b131bafc9a552cb13f7f2a7ea6a
1" (CNN) Wild tigers in India appear to be staging a comeback in the battle against extinction with the country’s Environment Minister announcing a 30% increase in the endangered species’ population since 2011. ”Our latest estimate today is that India has 70% of the world’s tiger population and we have now 2 226 tigers presently in 47 tiger reserves [up from 1 706 in 2011] and this is a great achievement. It is a net increase of 30% over the last estimation”  Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said in a statement Monday. Researchers involved in the study the third of its kind carried out in India say they used advanced technology to assess the population of the big cats.  Debbie Banks head of the Tiger Campaign at the Environmental Investigation Agency which carries out extensive research on the illegal tiger trade welcomed news of the study saying she looked forward to seeing the full report when it releases in March. ”I think it has set India apart from some of the other tiger range countries. If you look at China Laos Cambodia Vietnam Thailand there’s more emphasis on tigers in captivity farming and valuing tigers for their body parts higher than the survival of tigers in the wild” she says to CNN. India’s   tiger population has been severely affected by poaching a reduction in prey habitat destruction and conflict with villagers who may occupy the same area.  Although preliminary results of the government’s study are promising Banks warns against complacency. ”While this is good news from India I don’t think anyone is sitting back and saying ’we’ve won.’ The demand within China for skins to decorate homes and bones for tiger bone wine all continue. And so it’s a constant battle.” A major challenge is also the sophistication of the tiger trade where body parts of the animal are transported across unofficial borders such as mountain passes. ”The criminals have changed their practice. And there’s no evidence of any enforcement there” she says. A historical symbol of power and beauty in cultures such as India and China the significance of the tiger goes beyond its aesthetics Banks says.  ”Tigers are major indicator of the health of the environment certainly the health of the forest that they inhabit. But they are the water gods if you like. They are indicators of how well we are doing to conserve forests that provide water for millions of people and mitigate climate change.  ”There’s an ecosystem reason to save wild tigers.”  And if today’s results are anything to go by Banks says India appears to be leading that charge. ”India despite all the problems it has with high human population in small areas is totally setting the benchmark for wild tiger conservation.”"~ff79809c6e1d62cb829115fd7d5b01ce2d6a165e

" (CNN) Where Katy Perry needed a big cat the New England Patriots were carried to a stunning comeback by the resilience of Tom Brady. Follow us at @CNNSport and like us on Facebook The    sacked and twice intercepted refused to give in as the Patriots    at one point down by 10    fought their way to a   victory over the Seattle Seahawks in Glendale Arizona. They were helped by one of the less likely calls in football history as Seattle threw a second consecutive Super Bowl title into the hands of Malcolm Butler. Patriots rookie Butler made a   interception when the Seahawks with the ball on the   line and seconds to play mysteriously chose to pass after an improbable juggling   by Jermaine Kearse. That moment gave Brady and coach Bill Belichick a fourth Super Bowl victory a feat matched by only two other quarterbacks: Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw. ”I just had a vision that I was going to make a big play and it came true” said Butler 24. MVP Brady said: ”This has been a long journey. I’ve been at it for 15 years. This one came down to the end and this time we made the plays. ”Our defense what can you say about them? Malcolm what a play. For a rookie to make a play like that and win us the Super Bowl is unbelievable.”   jeers Ahead of the game Belichick had been booed inside Glendale’s University of Phoenix Stadium    the retractable roof unusually left open    as Idina Menzel the voice of Frozen’s Elsa sang the   national anthem. Belichick and Brady have denied any wrongdoing regarding the lengthy and unresolved ’deflategate’ saga which concerns underinflated footballs in the AFC Championship game against Indianapolis. However Brady was evasive on the subject in a   interview aired on Sunday and the jeers as Belichick appeared on the big screen made the feelings of many clear. With that controversy sidelined for the night the 49th Super Bowl’s momentum changed as rapidly as Perry’s halftime hits and outfits. The Patriots had largely outplayed Seattle before the interval Brady wearing down the Seahawks defense drive by drive. Brady in his sixth Super Bowl found Brandon LaFell for the opening touchdown. In the process the Patriots left Seattle’s famed ’Legion of Boom’ verging on bust. Seattle cornerback Jeremy Lane had already departed the field with an ugly arm injury    the price he paid for a successful interception    and with   Kam Chancellor Earl Thomas and Richard Sherman all carrying injuries substitute Tharold Simon became the latest Seahawk on the wrong end of a collision as he failed to stop LaFell. Brave move Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson essentially anonymous to this point struck back with the night’s first phenomenal pass to    rookie and former shoe salesman Chris Matthews. That allowed the NFL’s quiet man    Marshawn Lynch    to drive over the line and score. Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski mowed down KJ Wright to restore New England’s advantage but that only served to cue up one of the gutsier plays in Super Bowl history. With seconds remaining in the half the Seahawks abandoned the safe option of a field goal. Instead Wilson wasted just 1. 79 seconds in delivering a bullet pass down the throat of a jubilant Matthews in the end zone. Cue Katy Perry who brought an almost overwhelming array of lights pyrotechnics and songs to a halftime show she dedicated to her younger self. Arriving on a giant mechanical lion before graduating to a shimmy with sharks Perry opened with Roar before cramming in   blasts of Dark Horse I Kissed a Girl Teenage Dream and    lastly    Firework during which she ascended aboard a shooting star. Guest star Missy Elliott emerged to an energetic Get Ur Freak On relegating the show’s other name Lenny Kravitz to the background. When play restarted Seattle were at the fore.  Having barely seen the ball that   score sent the Seahawks into the second half in possession and in control. The reigning champions immediately moved up by three Matthews again wrapping up a   pass play to set up a Seahawks field goal. After Brady threw his second interception of the night Seattle wide receiver Doug Baldwin expertly lost New England’s Darrelle Revis by running him into an official    leaving Baldwin all alone in the end zone and the NFC champions ahead by 10. Legion of gloom Brady had been nowhere near perfect but demonstrated his determination as he shrugged off a poor throw missing Julian Edelman to find Danny Amendola and get the Patriots rolling again. Watched by the likes of Paul McCartney Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg the intensity of New England’s offense ground down the depleted Legion as the final minutes ticked away. With two minutes remaining Brady once again tried to find Edelman in the end zone. This time he was successful and the Patriots had overcome a   deficit. Seattle however should have had the last laugh. Having been granted a   slice of good fortune as the falling Kearse used both knees and a hand to somehow hold on to a pass the Seahawks made what some observers labelled one of the worst calls in football history. On the brink of    Super Bowl victories Seattle elected to throw the ball shunning Lynch and gifting Butler the interception. Following that staggering climax the game’s dying moments descended into a mass brawl which led to the ejection of the Seahawks’ Bruce Irvin. By that point the fight simply delayed an inevitable New England victory. ”I can’t even tell you I can’t even feel it” said Seahawks coach Pete Carroll of the decision to throw the ball. ”For it to come down to a play like that I hate that we have to live with that.” New England’s Edelman said: ”We made more plays we executed when we had to we have a mentally tough team that works their tails off. ”We are the epitome of what Boston is all about.”"~6b539b8b075734cca21ad1565cd25005e8eac7be

" (CNN) Usually dumping metal into the ocean is a bad thing but for once throwing disused items into the sea is working out for the greater good.  Over 2 500 New York subway cars have been used to create an underwater reef for crustaceans and fish in the Atlantic.  Over a period of three years photographer Stephen Mallon of the Front Room Gallery captured images of the carriages being put in place and his photos now are being shown in a solo exhibition in New York.   ”I had read about the subway cars being dropped into the Atlantic but I thought the project was over” said Mallon. ”Then in 2007 I was scouting for another shoot and saw the barges being loaded up.” Once the subway cars had been decommissioned they were cleaned and every part of them that could be removed    seats straps and wheels    was recycled or sold. Then the carriages were stacked onto a barge which transported them to the dropping point.  A hydraulic lift picked them up and dropped them one at a time into the ocean about once a month destined to become a long line of houses for sea life along the coast from Delaware to South Carolina.  ”I had never seen anything like this” Mallon said. ”And I’ve been in New York for over 20 years . .. there’s a sense of vertigo as they drop    you want to hold on as it falls.” The    has an ongoing project entitled American Reclamation that explores the recycling industry in America. Mallon captured his images from a small boat facing the barge in locations including Delaware Virginia and South Carolina.  Some cars have also been dropped in Georgia although not all site locations are disclosed to the public as some are used for ecological studies.  The project run by New York’s Metropolitan transit authority ended in 2010. But the carriages have a new life beneath the sea. ”We’ve been monitoring the carbon steel subway cars and they are holding up well” said Jeffrey Tinsman artificial reef program manager at the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.  ”They are still three dimensional and provide thousands and thousands of square feet of hard surface for invertebrates to live on some of which such as blue mussels could not live on the sand bottom that is naturally there.”  ”When you compare the amount of food available on this reef to the natural amount there is 400 times as much food per square foot as the sand bottom” Tinsman continued.  ”Fish such as black sea bass are not fast swimmers so need structure to provide both food and shelter they wouldn’t for example be able to outswim a shark but they could duck into the shelter instead.”  Stephen Mallon’s works are featured in the solo exhibition Patterns of Interest at NYU’s Kimmel Galleries from February 6 to March 15.

" (CNN) The University of Virginia and its campus police department are investigating a new report of a sexual assault in a campus residence as the college community struggles with how to move forward and improve its sexual assault policies after coming under national scrutiny. It’s the first report of a sexual assault on campus since the controversial and widely questioned Rolling Stone article published in October that depicted the brutal gang rape of a woman named Jackie. It’s also the only reported sexual assault in the university police public reports since the start of this   school year according to a CNN review of records on its website. There are few details about this newest case.  A statement sent to students on Thursday said police were notified by the Dean of Students ”about a sexual assault incident reported to have occurred on January 30 2015 in a residence hall  .”  The notice said police were notified on February 5 six days after the incident. Before the uproar over the Rolling Stone story UVA policy allowed student victims to decide whether or not police were contacted after a sexual assault. Since then the university mandated a ” ” policy which has yet to be defined it’s unclear if the alleged victim in the latest assault participated in reporting it to police. University officials would not comment on those questions. This all comes as the university is trying to move forward from the fallout of the Rolling Stone piece. The story of Jackie has been questioned and has prompted several investigations    a police investigation an internal review at UVA and a Columbia Journalism Review of Rolling Stone’s reporting process. A lot is still unknown. Here’s what we do and don’t know: 1. Is the Rolling Stone story about Jackie fake? What we know: Some of the details in the story are not true. Charlottesville police informed the university at the start of the spring semester that its investigation has found no evidence that the brutal gang rape happened at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity as the Rolling Stone story alleged. However the police have not ruled out that Jackie was raped    possibly even gang raped somewhere else perhaps on a different day. The investigation is ongoing and police aren’t releasing any other details of what they’ve found.  CNN talked to several of Jackie’s friends who were with her the night she says she was allegedly attacked and according to them she told a different version of what happened that night. In the article Jackie said she was   by seven men while two men looked on. Her friends said Jackie told them she was forced to give oral sex to five men. Jackie’s Rolling Stone version said the perpetrator was a man she met at her job at the university pool. She told her friends it was someone she met in her chemistry class. She told her friends the assailant’s name but no one by the name she gave attended the University of Virginia nor could anyone by that name be located in a database search across the United States. What we don’t know: We don’t know how much of the rest of the Rolling Stone story including Jackie’s account was correct. Jackie has not talked to any member of the media since Rolling Stone issued an apology for its reporting and the writer of the story has not spoken publicly since the apology either. Columbia Journalism Review is now   all of the details at the request of Rolling Stone. 2: What about other reports of rape at UVA? What we know: Some of the details in the Rolling Stone story that deal with the broader issue of how sexual assault reports are handled at UVA have been confirmed. For example the university has admitted that it never expelled a single student for committing sexual assault even when the student admitted it.  The law firm O’Melveny  Myers LLP is now looking into how the university has historically handled sex assault claims. Even before the Rolling Stone story UVA was the subject of a Title IX lawsuit filed by a woman who said she was drugged and raped by a fellow student and that the university medical center lost some of the evidence that a nurse didn’t tell the truth about the woman’s injuries and that a school administrator shared confidential information. In May 2014 the Department of Education for Civil Rights announced that it was investigating 55 schools including UVA for possible violations related to how it handles sex abuse claims. 3: What else is being investigated? What we know: Part of the independent investigation by O’Melveny  Myers is looking at how UVA responded specifically to Jackie’s astonishing accusations against members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. According to Rolling Stone Jackie first reported her allegations to the university in the spring of 2013 months after the alleged assault happened. The university did not call police because Jackie did not want the police involved Rolling Stone reported. However many people on campus were well aware of Jackie’s shocking allegations. Several people present at the annual ”Take Back the Night” awareness event listened as Jackie took to a podium and told her story to a crowd of hundreds in 2014. The police were not called until the account was published in Rolling Stone in November causing national scrutiny and outrage. What we don’t know: It’s unclear if police were aware in detail of the allegations before the Rolling Stone story was published. The fraternity Phi Kappa Psi expressed concern to police after members began to field questions from Rolling Stone about the allegation of a gang rape. It’s unclear exactly why that did not turn into a full police investigation. UVA officials were also involved in that conversation Phi Psi said. 4: What’s happening with the fraternities?  After being suspended for the rest of the fall semester the fraternities were allowed to come back in the spring as long as they signed a new operating agreement which mandates sober fraternity brothers at parties bans the serving of   drinks requires the use of guards at staircases and other safety measures. This created some tension.  Phi Psi was the first to sign the new agreement but two other fraternities accused the university of ”bullying” them into signing it.  Then days later some sorority members were appalled to learn that their national chapters banned them from attending any fraternity bid night activities on Saturday January 31 one of the biggest celebrations of the year in campus Greek life. From outside Charlottesville the University of Virginia appears to be a campus in turmoil struggling with how to move on from allegations that sexual assaults are rampant. But on campus many student leaders like Student Council President Jalen Ross agree that some of that discourse is good    it will help them come up with the best plans for moving forward. But Ross also told CNN he’s concerned with the level of involvement the national fraternity and sorority organizations have had and cautions that they do not speak for students on campus.​ 5. What about the rest of the campus? It’s clear from talking to students at UVA that many of them still see some merit to the criticisms of how the university handles sexual assault allegations. Many also believe that something bad may have happened to Jackie although they are skeptical of the details in the Rolling Stone story. Most students got back from winter break and returned to normal life at school. Behind the scenes leaders are working on new ways to tackle binge drinking and general campus safety. The university just adopted an ambassador program which provides sober escorts over the age of 21 for any student who needs help getting home. The ”zero tolerance policy” pledged after the Rolling Stone story has yet to be defined and some advocates are worried that it will have a chilling effect on reporting of sexual assault. Ross said he’s been working with state legislators who have proposed mandatory reporting to make sure that any new proposals also don’t discourage women from coming forward.

" (CNN) They are very convincing when they call. They have a Washington phone number and can cite your financial history down to the cent. They say you’re under investigation in danger of losing your home or worse your freedom    unless you pay thousands of dollars on the spot. But they’re not real.  And you’re not in trouble.  Not unless you take it seriously.  This is a scam. A big one. Federal authorities say it’s the largest IRS impersonation scam they’ve ever seen    swindling victims out of more than $15 million since it began in 2013. ”They have information that only the Internal Revenue Service would know about you” said Timothy Camus deputy inspector general for investigations with the Treasury Department. ”It’s a byproduct of today’s society. There’s so much information available on individuals.” Using identity theft technology the thieves have successfully victimized more than 3 000 people in the past two years although the Treasury Department cautions that number is only documented cases and the true number might be higher. Camus said they’ve recorded more than 366 000 reports of contact with the scammers and it’s increasing at a rate of 10 000 to 12 000 a week. Authorities believe the thieves are operating out of India using phishing technology to make it appear they’re IRS agents in Washington. The Federal Trade Commission which goes after scammers like these from a civil standpoint and the Treasury Department which leads the criminal probe both have open investigations. The largest loss reported was a staggering $500 000 Camus said. Most have lost about $5 000. One of those victims was former NFL player Frank Garcia who is now a sports radio host in Charlotte North Carolina. When he got the call it sounded so authentic he left the radio station in a panic scramming to get the money they wanted. 12 scams to avoid ”The only thing running through my head is I’m going to jail. I’m gonna be on television in handcuffs for tax evasion” he recalled. ”I had to follow specific steps not to be arrested. That the authorities had been contacted and in fact they are on the way and will be there in 30 minutes.” Garcia says he spent five hours driving to various stores around Charlotte depositing $500 each time into a PayPal account set up by the woman on the phone. He ended up losing about $4 000.  He and other victims told CNN the swindlers never let their victims hang up the phone. ”I have never been arrested in my life and was very scared” said Kin Ko a New Jersey resident who lost about $5 000 after he says the impersonator told him he was facing five years in prison and the IRS was about to confiscate his assets: His car his house and all the money in his bank account. The person had a badge number read him an arrest warrant from a nearby police jurisdiction. The thieves are incredibly smart and convincing. They harness stolen identities and use programs such as Google Earth to identity locations where their victims can transfer money. ”It sounded as legitimate as could be” said Al Cadenhead a pastor in North Carolina who also fell victim. ”They knew where I was. He told me where to go    to the Rite Aid up two streets turn left to the Rite Aid. The names of the streets it was really just incredible.” Cadenhead told CNN he didn’t come to his senses until he’d signed over $16 000. Identity theft tops list of consumer complaints ”It was like I came out of a coma and realized this was not normal and this is not how you do business” he said. ”I know other people who’ve heard the story say ’How did a guy with a Ph. D. fall victim?’ I was the perfect victim. I’ve never been audited never paid a traffic ticket. I don’t know how to pay fines. How do I know they aren’t stern and serious about everything?” Camus said many people are afraid when they hear from the IRS so they do whatever the caller says. In December federal authorities found and arrested two U. S.  ”runners” who admitted to transferring almost a million dollars from   cards to foreign bank accounts.  In many cases victims are warned and stopped from sending more money by bank tellers or clerks at money wiring locations. Ko said that it was a bank teller who told him this was a scam when the impersonator asked him to go through a second round of depositing money. For Frank Garcia the light came on when the woman on the phone asked him for another $8 000 after he thought his debt had been paid. He says he decided to hang up and await what the woman promised would be an arrest    which of course never came. How hackers are stealing your tax refund ”I felt taken advantage of. I felt small. And I was naive” he said. ”I wasn’t aware. I didn’t understand the system. And didn’t blame anybody but myself for not taking more time to understand those things.” Often Camus says immigrants are targeted and threatened with deportation. The elderly are also a popular target although the scam has grown so large people of all ages income levels and status are getting these calls. Treasury Department officials say if you get one of these calls the best and simplest way to handle it is to hang up.  Camus himself a Treasury Department investigator even got one. He told them ”Your time is coming.”"~eb17dfa54a89b0dec9303d923fbcbba278f48b04
3" (CNN) What is it about iconic photographs that captivates our imaginations long after the last tank has rolled into Tiananmen Titanic set sail or Apollo 11 astronauts left their footprints across the moon? Even if you weren’t alive at the time these images are stamped in our minds with all the familiarity of a family photo album.  So when Swiss artists Jojakim Cortis and Adrian Sonderegger set about recreating the world’s most famous photos in miniature models the pressure was on to ensure every tuft of cloud clump of soil and tilt of the head was true to its original. ”Everybody knows these pictures    they stand for a special moment in history” said    Cortis who when not creating intricate scenes out of cardboard and cotton wool works as a   advertising and magazine photographer with    Sonderegger. ”You can divide iconic pictures into two different kinds    there are the ones we only know from books because they’re so old.. And then there are the more recent ones like   where everybody remembers what they were doing at the time. When people look at these pictures the feelings are more personal.” Making history The ambitious project called ”Icons” started with a joke about copying one of the world’s most valuable photographs    Andreas Gursky’s Rhein II. When it was auctioned for $4. 3 million in 2011 the seemingly simple image of Germany’s River Rhein was the most expensive photograph ever sold.  The artistic duo have since recreated around a dozen more famous images over the last three years. When bringing to life Sam Shere’s 1937 photograph of the Hindenburg disaster plumes of cotton wool were dramatically back lit with a light bulb to emulate the moment of explosion. Buzz Aldrin’s 1969 image of his own bootprint on the moon took a little more    from the inventive pair who initially used sand and then switched to concrete to get the lunar texture just right. No small feat The most   model of all was Stuart Franklin’s 1989 ”Tank Man” a picture which captured the eerie moment a lone figure obstructed the path of military tanks during student protests in Tiananmen Square. ”We bought the tanks on eBay from China” explained Cortis. ”They were these model kits which we had to put together.” ”We had to build around seven or eight tanks    the first one was fun the second one was ok and then after that it was just hard work” he said of the scene which took two weeks to complete. Capturing humanity But by far the most challenging object to imitate is people    hence why their faces are so often obscured in Cortis and Sonderegger’s models. Ease of creation rather than emotional attachment has so far been the deciding factor when choosing a photograph.   That said the artists still trawled through countless toy stores on their mission to find a figurine with the same toes as the hooded prisoner in the 2003 Abu Ghraib image. Meanwhile the   kidnapper depicted in Ludwig Wegmann’s photograph of the 1972 Munich Olympics was created with playdough and women’s stockings. Much like a doll’s house or ship in a bottle perhaps part of the allure of these models is the wonder in real world objects shrunk to the palm of your hand. ”All these tiny things I think everybody likes it” agreed Cortis. ”Maybe it’s like remembering childhood when you played with little things.” Dark past The pair have just finished making a miniature version of U. S. President John Kennedy’s 1963 assassination in Dallas and Cortis is at a loss for words as to why so many of our   photographs are also some of humanity’s darkest. ”It’s not that we had it in our mind to recreate negative pictures. But I think there just seem to be more negative iconic pictures than positive ones” he said. ”But there is hope. History is still going on. And the project’s not finished yet.” A peek inside Europe’s most prestigious photography fair Aerial photos capture the eerie photography of everyday life Greatest building you’ll never see: 19 monuments lost in war"~e20886ca7da29a9bc5cda3bd78957bec904d90c5
5" (CNN) Dressed in a glistening wetsuit and sitting behind the wheel of a golf cart Sam Harrison admits he looks like the most absurd fish out of water you’ve ever seen. Get him in a lake however and the    is a   treasure hunter with the instinct of a shark able to uncover his prey in zero visibility and   temperatures. In this case the prey is golf balls. And with an estimated 300 million of the wayward white orbs lost in the U. S. alone each year there is serious money to be made from their recovery    if you’re willing to take the plunge. Imagine swimming in a milkshake of silt. Now add weeds broken bottles and every type of critter from leeches to water snakes even crocodiles and you’ve pretty much got the idea of the perils of   diving. Making money from misfortune For even the world’s best golfers one of the most fearsome holes in sport will rear its watery head this week at the prestigious PLAYERS Championship in TPC Sawgrass Florida    the infamous 17th hole. The ”Island Green” as it is known is a peninsula measuring just over 120 meters completely surrounded by water. It’s a nightmare for players and a potential gold mine for   divers. But for those unable to plunge the depths of Sawgrass’ bountiful lakes is the job of   diving really worth the effort? ”On average you’ll find 5 000 balls per lake” says Harrison who    when not taking a leap of faith on Britain’s golf courses    can be found working as a banker in London.  ”Say we’re selling the balls we find at an average 50p (75 cents)” explains the   of Lake Ball Diving. ”That would give us £2 500 ($3 700)” said Harrison estimating that in a year he could earn up to £100 000 ($150 000). It’s a similar story in America according to Paul Lovelace who has been diving for ”white gold” over the past three decades. ”I think everybody has a dream of diving for sunken treasure    and that’s basically what we’re doing every day” says the    owner of Golf Ball Paul’s who previously worked as a    diver on offshore oil rigs. ”It’s the thrill of the hunt.” The most prized catch of all is the Titleist Pro V1. Pluck a bagload of these premier balls from the bottom of a   lake he says and you know it’s a good day. ”A perfect Titleist? You can retail that for $2” says Lovelace speaking by phone from his Kansas warehouse stacked high with bulky sacks of balls waiting to be washed and sorted for sale. But even before he or Harrison hit the water there are significant outlay costs. On both sides of the pond (in this case the Atlantic Ocean) golf courses charge divers between   per ball they find. And that can quickly add up to hundreds of dollars. Nature calls Once in the water you’re lucky to see more than a foot in front of you and Lovelace has one piece of advice for new divers: ”If you’re grabbing stuff down there and it’s not round    don’t pick it up!” ”In the Midwest we have snapping turtles and they can take off fingers and hands and toes and other extremities if you’re not careful.” In other parts of the world the risks are more extreme. Last year    Jacques van der Sandt was killed by a crocodile after retrieving golf balls from a national park in South Africa. While in Florida    Steve Martinez was bitten by an alligator while diving at a country club. In the UK Harrison often comes face to face with water snakes. ”Sometimes you rough up the reeds and you can see one of them swimming towards you” he says adding that he’s usually   in pitch black darkness with nothing more than a fog light and a rake. But perhaps more worrying is the water itself. ”On some courses the lakes are more like sewers” he says. ”In those stagnant pools you can catch diseases so you have to wear a head guard a bit like an    wetsuit so nothing can get on you.” One man’s trash The bizarre array of objects buried at the bottom of a lake tell of woe on the sporting field. Not just the odd golf club hurled in anger but entire bags    and even a motorized cart    have been found by divers. If you’re getting into this messy business because you enjoy scuba diving in tropical locales you better think again says Harrison. ”Don’t get me wrong I’d much rather be diving in the Red Sea seeing some picturesque fish than broken beer bottles” he says. ”But overall I generally enjoy it. And you never know” he adds ”you might find a lake where you hit the jackpot.” Read: Tiger Woods hits new low Watch: The world’ leading golf course architects ​"~a1da528b05d1975e1de6a5b45bd6c9bb8354f148
12" (CNN) It’s a vision of biblical proportions    tens of thousands of people weeping whooping and chanting in unison. If sport were a religion then the stadium would surely be its place of worship.  Inside these temples to physical feats language evokes the divine    fearful fans ”pray for a miracle” while losing prompts serious ” .”  So much so that architects these days must create more than a stage for human endurance. It’s as if they have been asked to perform the architectural equivalent of feeding the 5 000 with five loaves and two fish    constructing an arena to elevate the senses capture the spirit of a community and become an icon for a city long after the last fan has passed through the turnstiles. ”It’s like creating a contemporary cathedral in some ways” said Spela Videcnik architect behind the   ”spotty” Borisov Arena home to the Belarus national football team. ”Often the stadium is meant to become the pride of a city a landmark object and as such a monument representing the latest achievements in architecture.” Since ancient Greeks built the first Olympic stadium in fine white marble the arena has been as much about inspiring awe as staging competition.  Today’s architects must go even further. Return to Roman times? In an age where sporting events are captured on television in brilliant detail designers must lure us from the comfort of living rooms with multipurpose entertainment centers. No longer relegated to the outskirts of town these   social hubs are creeping inside our metropolises once more    and they have more in common with historic cathedrals than you might think. ”Look at the ancient Greek and Roman stadiums    they’re very much in the middle of the city” said Hubert Nienhoff veteran German architect behind the redeveloped Berlin Olympic Stadium and Amazon Arena at this year’s World Cup in Brazil. ”But in the last 50 years the stadium became something that was not really integrated they were built outside the cities. They were for people who went there perhaps once a week for an event.” While arenas like the Colosseum in the heart of Rome occupy real estate today’s architects could only dream of we may soon see a return to centralized social spaces of old says Nienhoff. ”Now we’re bringing in multiple uses for stadiums again like shops and conference halls” he said. ”In the future they will not be outside the city but something like the cathedrals of the Middle Ages they will be a vital part of city life.”  A key part of this vision however will depend on improved transport infrastructure. ”There was a trend back in the 1980s of treating stadiums a bit like shopping centers. So you’d try and put them on the edges of cities” said architect Clive Lewis designer behind the Singapore National Stadium and Sports Hub and winner at this year’s World Architecture Festival award. ”But more and more it’s important to make a stadium that’s part of the city. They need to be integrated into the transport infrastructure so they’re a naturally connected part of the city    the event should start as soon as you leave your house.” He goes one step further with a vision of one roof to house all of humanity. ”For me stadiums have taken over the function of a cathedral. It’s a building that brings together people of all ages all cultures all religions. ”And the only other thing that comes close to that is an airport.” Lasting legacy At the heart of an arena both physically and spiritually is its playing area. And with the outcome of multimillion dollar matches riding on everything from grass quality to the position of the sun designers must get it pitch perfect. Does that mean architects need to be sports fans themselves?  ”Do we need to be religious to build a church? We don’t think so” comes the reply from Berger Architects the company behind the brilliantly illuminated Luanda Multisports Pavilion in Angola. ”Architects must be able to project themselves and think as if they were the final users of the space they’re designing.” And long after the grand final trophies have been handed out an arena must serve its people for decades to come. ”Whether we’re designing for the Olympics or the World Cup we’re always actually thinking ahead to what we’re going to do with the venue after that event” said Lewis whose Singapore Sports Hub hopes to hold 200 events every year. ”And I think there’s a history in recent years of relatively few examples that have done that very well.” Perhaps the most striking example of this failure is Athens.  The Greek capital may be the home of the modern Olympics but over a century later its 2004 stadia has become a modern ruin of its own with venues overgrown with weeds walls covered in graffiti and seating rotted away.  It’s an   death for an event which cost the country around $11 billion to host. Entertainment plus Step inside today’s stadiums and you’ll find an entertainment juggernaut where fans are encouraged to dig deep into their pockets long before the first  . ”Over the last 50 years corporate interests have changed stadiums more than anything else. Years ago stadiums were just bare concrete and no seats just bleachers” said Lewis. ”Today it’s a lot more about the corporate experience    the internal lounge corporate boxes restaurants. Which means that people are coming to the venue an hour or two before the event and not leaving for an hour or two afterwards.” The goal for stadium owners is to create an icon for the city    one worthy of their name stamped across it in bright lights. ”The mayor asked us for something that would ’put Durban on the map’” says Nienhoff of the Moses Mabhiba Stadium in Durban built for the 2010 South African World Cup. ”If you looked at Durban from the waterside there was nothing you could remember specifically from the skyline.” That was before Neinhoff’s stark white arena was built on the coastline its swooping 350 meter arched entrance and ruffled roof a sight to behold. Natural instinct But before Nienhoff even puts pen to paper one of the first places he looks for inspiration is nature. With its reptilian façade the Amazon Arena built in Manaus for the World up in Brazil this year borrows much from the surrounding jungle. ”If you look into the structures of nature like a leaf or the skin of a snake there’s always a logical system behind it” explained Nienhoff. ”Manaus is in the middle of a rainforest so that’s where we turned for inspiration. We’re really trying to design something that’s only meant for this one place.” Like nature itself these modern day temples of pleasure will also need to regenerate themselves in order to survive.

5" (CNN) It’s a dilemma 1960s TV character Jan Brady knew well: ”How do you stand out when you’re the middle sister?”  Indeed her ranting against sophisticated elder sibling    ”Marcia Marcia Marcia”    became one of the most memorable catchphrases in the   U. S. sitcom The Brady Bunch. But the middle sister needn’t be overlooked.  In fact if the Preakness Stakes    the second horse race in America’s prestigious Triple Crown    is anything to go by sometimes the quiet ones have the greatest stories to tell. The Kentucky Derby may be the first and most famous of the trifecta    won by jockey Victor Espinoza atop American Pharoah earlier this month. But the Preakness which is run in Baltimore this Saturday also offers a fascinating history unique atmosphere and special significance in the march towards the third race in the crown the Belmont Stakes.  Here are five fun reasons why the Preakness Stakes is one to watch: Silver service The trophy is so valuable not even the winners are allowed to hold it.  The mammoth   solid silver Woodlawn Vase created by Tiffany and Co. in 1860 is worth $1 million    making it the most valuable trophy in American sports.  But the immense pressure of safeguarding it for an entire year was too much for the wife of 1953’s winning owner Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt who instead convinced her husband to leave it the hands of organizers. The trophy now remains on permanent display at the Baltimore Museum of Art with winners instead given a $30 000 replica trophy. Blooming ingenious Sometimes if nature won’t bloom you’ve just got to paint it yourself. So it goes for the iconic ”  Susan” blanket traditionally draped across the shoulders of the winning horse. The blanket takes three days to create featuring 80 bunches of normal yellow daisies strung together and attached to a rubber base with the underside covered in thick felt. But because the   Susan    the official flower for the state of Maryland    doesn’t sprout until June artists must instead paint the center of the daisies black. You’re so ’vane’ The paintwork continues atop Pimlico Race Course’s Old Clubhouse where each year the weather vane is daubed in the winner’s colors. As soon as the race is over the 1.  wide weather vane featuring a miniature horse and jockey is painted in the winning jockey’s silks. The unusual tradition started in 1909 after the building’s original   weather vane was struck by lightning and replaced with the ornamental iron rider. Sign painter Michael Willinger took on the job in 1987 saying: ”It is just the thrill of being able to participate in a big local and national event like this. Let’s face it it’s the only televised   job in the country.” Family ties If ever there was a big daddy of Preakness Gallant Fox is it. The champion thoroughbred not only won the U. S. Triple Crown in 1930 he went on to sire the winners of more than 90 Preakness Stakes. It was a case of like father like son when Gallant Fox’s offspring Omaha also won the Triple Crown in 1935. Gallant Fox won 11 of his 17 races before retiring at the grand old age of three. The super stud died in 1954 aged 27.  Race adjourned Still looking for proof that Preakness is a race that stops a nation? Look no further than the day it brought Government to a standstill. The U. S. House of Representatives adjourned for the only time in history in 1877 to watch what was known as the ”Great Race.” More than 20 000 people flocked to Pimlico to watch three thoroughbreds    Parole Ten Broeck and Tom Ochiltree    battle it out on the field.    gelding Parole triumphed and local pool halls saloons and baseball clubs were renamed in his honor.

" (CNN) British actress Emma Watson made an impassioned plea to women around the world: ”Don’t let anyone tell you what you can or cannot do or cannot achieve. ”Just don’t allow it. It’s wrong. It’s so wrong. Be what you want to be    and prove them wrong.” The emotional Harry Potter star took to the stage at Facebook’s headquarters in London on Sunday March 8 to talk about gender equality as part of International Women’s Day celebrations.  CNN was among the live audience of around 150 people    with millions more watching the live stream across the world    the    UN Goodwill Ambassador spoke about her own feminist journey. Emma’s Facebook moment  Of the dozens gathered at the event the majority were bespectacled young men    not so unlike Harry Potter himself.  Describing the ”surreal” moment she gave a speech at U. N. headquarters later watched by 17 million Watson said:  ”Gender equality historically has been a woman’s movement.  ”And how it’s affecting men hasn’t been addressed” she told moderator Greg James.   During the   conversation Watson gave the audience a  rare glimpse into her private life    and the difference between chivalry and sexism. ”I love having the door opened for me isn’t that just polite?” she said. ”But I think the key is would you then mind me opening the door for you?” ”Chivalry should be consensual.” And it’s not just women affected by gender inequality    men suffer too she added. ”I get disturbed by this idea that men can’t cry” she continued.  ”They can’t express themselves and I think that’s the saddest thing in the world. Being able to express yourself is what makes you human    it’s not what makes you a girl.” When internet trolls threatened to release naked photos of the actress following her UN speech she said it only made her more determined in her campaign. ”If they were trying to put me off    they did the opposite” she added. Almost 230 000 men and boys across the world have since joined the HeForShe campaign including U. S. President Barack Obama and actors Joseph   and Matt Damon. ”I read a letter of support from a    boy that was equally as passionate as a CEO” said Watson adding that she often read their stories before going to bed at night. ”I asked my younger sister: ’What would be the one thing you’d want from boys in your life?’ She said: ’I just want them to play with us.’ And I think that really translates at every level. We just want to be included.” Watson also talked about the inspiring influence of her mother Jacqueline who was a ”single working mother and type one diabetic.” ”She wanted me to be my own person and said a bit of rebellion was good” said Watson adding: ”She was actually thrilled when I got my first detention. .. I think I failed a Latin exam.”  Answering questions submitted via Facebook Watson said the recent lack of female representation at the Academy Awards showed that the fight for gender equality was far from over. ”Why are women not directing their own stories?” she said.  ”The human race is a bird    and it needs both its wings to fly. And at the moment one of its wings is clipped” said Watson paraphrasing famous American feminist Gloria Steinem. When asked what things we can all do to affect change the actress said it wasn’t necessarily about grand actions    but small ones. ”It’s everyday it’s individual it’s on a case by case basis” she said. ”Whether it’s speaking up or trying to change the way someone else thinks about an issue.” In the audience a man wearing a Hogwarts jumper asked Watson whether women should be paid the same as men when they are more likely to take maternity leave.  She answered: ”I don’t think in the grand scheme of things [maternity leave] is going to hinder a woman being incredibly effective in her field. ”I think men should be equal partners in raising children.” Those missing out on a place still got watch it live on Watson’s Facebook page.

"Beijing (CNN)  air rage is now served both hot and cold. Last month a   Thai AirAsia flight was forced to return to Bangkok after a female Chinese passenger threw hot water on a flight attendant amid a heated argument between her boyfriend and the cabin crew over service. On Saturday passengers on a plane departing Kunming Changshui International Airport in southwestern China angry with the crew for turning off the   during the   process opened three emergency exits just as their plane was pushing back from the gate.  The flight was canceled and 25 passengers onboard were detained. China Eastern Airlines flight MU2036 bound for Beijing was already seven hours behind schedule at 3:45 a. m. when crew began to   the plane at the Kunming airport which saw more than 100 flights delayed or canceled that night because of snowy weather. Frustrated by the lengthy delay some of the 153 passengers    who had been sitting on the plane for two hours    exploded with rage when the   stopped and an elderly passenger complained about discomfort due to the stuffy cabin airport police told state media Saturday night. Dissatisfied with the pilot’s explanation about the need for   to be off during the     process members of a tour group started quarreling with the crew according to police. When the Boeing   jet finally pushed back from the gate three of its four    emergency exits suddenly popped open. Photos circulating on social media show two opened exits on the right side of the cabin with passengers still seated as well as crews and police on board documenting evidence. Air rage and emergency exists: Stormy weeks in Chinese aviation Anger common in   China After detaining and questioning all 25 members of the tour group the authorities announced that a male member of the group prompted by a female tour guide opened two exits on the right side.  Both were sent to jail for 15 days while police continued to look for the person who opened the exit on the left side. As news of the incident spread some Chinese Internet users sympathized with the perpetrators because of the delay but many considered their punishment too lenient and suggested airlines should blacklist them for life. Air rage is a common sight in   China and Saturday’s episode was not the first dramatic incident involving irate passengers at Kunming airport.  One of the country’s busiest hubs more than 32 million fliers passed through its terminal last year. In August 2012 31 passengers from a   flight tried to stop other planes from leaving Kunming by forcing their way onto the tarmac and occupying a taxiway for half an hour   Xinhua news agency reported. The following February some 50 passengers from a canceled flight stormed several gates at the airport in an attempt to prevent other travelers from boarding their flights.  Police had to disperse the angry crowd with pepper spray according to Xinhua. Exporting air rage With the exponential growth of outbound tourism Chinese travelers now seem to be exporting their air rage overseas as well with several incidents resulting in flight delays or diversions recorded in recent years. In February 2012 a Chinese couple was kicked off their United flight from Guam to Shanghai after they repeatedly yelled at a flight attendant and told her to ”shut up” when she tried to move their luggage in the overhead bin to accommodate other passengers. In September that year a Swiss flight bound for Beijing was forced to return to Zurich when a fight broke out between two Chinese men over a reclined seat. In February 2014 a fight erupted between two groups of Chinese passengers before their flight could take off from the Thai resort island of Phuket resulting in 29 people being taken off the plane. Then in April a Thai Airways   from Bangkok to Beijing turned bloody when a brawl involving three Chinese men broke out. During an official visit to the Maldives in September President Xi Jinping personally asked Chinese tourists to behave themselves while traveling abroad. Last year the government released a lengthy list of do’s and don’ts aimed at turning Chinese travelers into ”civilized tourists.”"~6350085eb09f3a20a328e984828c26ef23d7e842
"Hong Kong (CNN) A    girl in Hong Kong could be removed from her father’s care after she was arrested for drawing chalk flowers on a wall at one of the city’s   protest sites. The girl was arrested in the early hours of December 23 at a staircase leading to the Central Government Offices in the city’s Admiralty district and was detained by police for 17 hours said Patricia Ho the lawyer acting for the teen.  A judge ruled in a youth court on Monday that the girl should be sent to a children’s home for 20 days until January 19. On Wednesday local media reported the girl was released from the children’s home on bail. The wall known as the ”Lennon Wall” was once covered with colorful   notes and messages of support for the recent   protests in Hong Kong. When the protests were cleared the notes were removed as well. Protestors started placing notes on the wall as a show of defiance after police used tear gas on demonstrators at the start of the protest which lead to a   occupation of the main road outside the Central Government Office. The wall was named after the late Beatles star John Lennon and contained messages of support for the protests and references to his song ”Imagine.” ’An innocent political prisoner’ Ho said the move was ”premature and disproportionate.” ”It wasn’t an application by the Social Welfare Department as it usually would be” she said. ”Police threw in a bunch of facts they obtained about the family in a very superficial manner.” Meanwhile the court is considering an application by Hong Kong police that she be removed from the care of her father who according to Ho is seriously hearing impaired and cannot understand the case. The move has angered activists student activist group Scholarism have set up a petition protesting the court ruling and some protestors have started drawing on the road as a protest outside the children’s home in Tuen Mun where the teenager is being held. Gary Tsang who participated in Hong Kong’s   street occupations told CNN the teen was ”an innocent political prisoner” and the use of the law in this case was ”obviously politically motivated.” ”The government fears young people as they thinks young people have nothing to lose” he said. Another protestor Anson Chui told CNN the police have lost their common sense and said there would be more similar arrests. ”Most (people). .. know that we cannot really cause any damage on the wall by drawing with chalk” he said. ”It is just an excuse used by the police to make us fear. Especially when the court said they are taking away the girl from her father.” The move comes after police also made an application for a care or protection order for a teenage boy who was arrested during the clearance of another protest site in Mong Kok earlier this month. The court file said the boy’s parents failed to exercise proper guardianship over him.  The court dates for both teenagers will take place in January.  Continued resistance A small protest camp outside the Legislative Council still remains and there is a small police presence on the site. Police officers are guarding Lennon Wall and remove all notes posted to it at the end of each day. New Year’s Eve countdown events at popular shopping districts such as Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui were canceled because of fears that protestors would attempt to hijack the events.  Since the protest sites were cleared demonstrators have resorted to other forms of protest such as the   ”shopping revolution” which involves protestors blocking the sidewalks and flooding shopping districts every night with yellow umbrellas. Hong Kong Police have not responded to requests for comment."~2b5955b54b48668bf0832b8ebbc86e5658cf2383
" (CNN) For New York’s newest police commissioner James O’Neill the Chelsea explosion was his initiation into the new job.  The blast which wounded 29 people on Saturday night and the discovery of a pressure cooker device set the city on edge on what should’ve been a vibrant night on Manhattan’s west side.   New York blast ’obviously an act of terrorism’ governor says At the late night news conference where authorities announced their initial findings O’Neill took the mic to reassure residents the NYPD was on full alert and an investigation underway.  But his was an unfamiliar face to most. Saturday marked his first full day on the job as the city’s 43rd commissioner succeeding William Bratton.  O’Neill was sworn in Friday     Bratton’s last day on the job.  So just who is the man who oversees the largest police department in the United States? He’s a   police veteran  O’Neill has over three decades of experience with the force first beginning his career in 1983 with the transit police.  ”He credits his time on patrol on the trains and platforms of the subway system with helping him learn how to interact and communicate with a wide range of people a skill he regards as essential to successful police work” the NYPD website says.  He gradually rose through the ranks including as commanding officer of the 25th 44th and Central Park precincts followed by chief of patrol. In 2014 he was named chief of department the NYPD’s highest uniformed rank before replacing Bratton.  He’s from New York  Flatbush Brooklyn to be exact. He grew up as one of seven children later attending John Jay College. He’s known to go by ”Jim” or ”Jimmy.” He has two sons Daniel and Christopher and is described by the NYPD as an ”avid hockey player and motorcyclist.” Crime down but challenges ahead He’s inherited a record low crime rate thanks to Bratton’s tenure but will have to grapple with other significant challenges especially surrounding issues of race and terrorism.  O’Neill has a demonstrated track record when it comes to racial relations. He pioneered the idea of neighborhood policing or building relationships between police officers and the community to increase trust    and not long after stepping up to Chief of Department he handled the protests around Eric Garner’s death and the subsequent assassinations of two detectives.  He’s said he will focus on reconnecting the police force and residents.  ”Fighting crime is what we get paid to do” O’Neill said according to the NYPD website. ”But we can’t do that unless we achieve full partnership with the community. Unless we have that connectivity it’s not going to work.”"~c4de3d2c6733a7a2f2bc02f15723cf4b3df9e9eb
"Kenny Wells the feckless owner of a Nevada mining company is the latest entry in the Matthew McConaughey gallery of charming rogues. Swaybacked and paunchy with a thinning dome and an appetite for Winstons and Seagram’s that would keep both brands in business if the rest of the world went cold turkey Kenny doesn’t quite have the wolfish charisma or the mystical intensity of some of Mr. McConaughey’s other recent characters. But like them  —   like Mick Haller in “The Lincoln Lawyer” Ron Woodroof in “Dallas Buyers Club” and that guy in those car commercials  —   he is fun to watch and hard not to root for. “Gold” which chronicles a few of Kenny’s rises and falls in the 1980s describes itself as “inspired by actual events” but inspiration is precisely what the film directed by Stephen Gaghan from a script by Patrick Massett and John Zinman seems to lack. Mr. McConaughey is a ball of profane entrepreneurial energy bouncing around in a vacuum. The story swings from the Nevada desert to the Indonesian rain forest to Wall Street boardrooms and the screen bristles with signifiers of capitalist activity: meetings phone calls stock tickers. But the movie isn’t really doing any work. It’s just looking busy. Having nearly run the family prospecting business into the ground (so to speak) Kenny gambles on the expertise of a Mike Acosta (Édgar Ramírez) a geologist with an almost mystical reputation. They strike gold in Indonesia and a gilded future opens up for Kenny and his longtime girlfriend Kaylene (Bryce Dallas Howard). There are shadows and complications of course including the corruptions of wealth the treachery of rivals and Kenny’s own impulsiveness. Broad hints are dropped that things will end badly. But enough goes wrong along the way  —   with the movie I mean not with Mike and Kenny’s scheme  —   to make the outcome feel almost moot. The film is well cast: You can’t really go wrong with Bill Camp Corey Stoll Stacy Keach and Bruce Greenwood. It’s beautifully shot (you can’t go wrong with Robert Elswit either). There is a pleasingly sleazy swaggering   ’80s vibe. And there are flickering reminders of other ambitious   mock epics as if the filmmakers were hoping an algorithm would deposit “Gold” in the queues of viewers who liked “American Hustle” “The Big Short” and Mr. Gaghan’s own “Syriana. ” With this material he could have gone in any number of interesting directions which may have been part of the problem. “Gold” could have been a biting satire of greed and folly a   tale of Western misadventure in Asia a rousing fable of underdog triumph or a caper comedy. It tries in its frantic clumsy fashion to be all of those things and comes close enough to succeeding to qualify as an honorable failure. What holds your attention is the question of whether that description fits Kenny as well. He could just as well be the opposite  —   a dishonorable success. He is far from a subtle guy but Mr. McConaughey is a sly enough actor to make us wonder whether we’re in the company of a fool or a con artist and to make us question whether there’s really a difference. His wild abrasive and improbably delicate performance is what makes “Gold” watchable even if the rest of the movie doesn’t supply sufficient reason to keep watching."~c8404a2df9c85b8684a66fe01ab13decf955219b
"A few weeks ago in reaction to something we had written about blackness and whiteness in recent movies my colleague Manohla Dargis and I received a note from a reader. “Since when is everything about race?” he wanted to know. Perhaps it was a rhetorical question. A flippant  —   though by no means inaccurate  —   answer would have been 1619. But a more constructive response might have been to recommend Raoul Peck’s   new documentary “I Am Not Your Negro. ” Let me do so now for that reader (if he’s still interested) and for everybody else too. Whatever you think about the past and future of what used to be called “race relations”  —   white supremacy and the resistance to it in plainer English  —   this movie will make you think again and may even change your mind. Though its principal figure the novelist playwright and essayist James Baldwin is a man who has been dead for nearly 30 years you would be   to find a movie that speaks to the present moment with greater clarity and force insisting on uncomfortable truths and drawing stark lessons from the shadows of history. To call “I Am Not Your Negro” a movie about James Baldwin would be to understate Mr. Peck’s achievement. It’s more of a posthumous collaboration an uncanny and thrilling communion between the filmmaker  —   whose previous work includes both a documentary and a narrative feature about the Congolese   leader Patrice Lumumba  —   and his subject. The   narration (read by Samuel L. Jackson) is entirely drawn from Baldwin’s work. Much of it comes from notes and letters written in the   when Baldwin was somewhat reluctantly sketching out a book never to be completed about the lives and deaths of Medgar Evers Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Reflections on those men (all of whom Baldwin knew well) and their legacies are interspersed with passages from other books and essays notably “The Devil Finds Work” Baldwin’s 1976 meditation on race Hollywood and the mythology of white innocence. His published and unpublished words  —   some of the most powerful and penetrating ever assembled on the tortured subject of American identity  —   accompany images from old talk shows and news reports from classic movies and from our own decidedly    present. Baldwin could not have known about Ferguson and Black Lives Matter about the presidency of Barack Obama and the recrudescence of white nationalism in its wake but in a sense he explained it all in advance. He understood the deep contradictory patterns of our history and articulated with a passion and clarity that few others have matched the psychological dimensions of racial conflict: the suppression of black humanity under slavery and Jim Crow and the insistence on it in   politics and art the dialectic of guilt and rage forgiveness and denial that distorts relations between black and white citizens in the North as well as the South the lengths that white people will go to wash themselves clean of their complicity in oppression. Baldwin is a double character in Mr. Peck’s film. The elegance and gravity of his formal prose and the gravelly authority of Mr. Jackson’s voice stand in contrast to his quicksilver   presence as a lecturer and television guest. In his skinny tie and narrow suit an omnipresent cigarette between his fingers he imports a touch of midcentury intellectual cool into our overheated   media moment. A former child preacher he remained a natural if somewhat reluctant performer  —   a master of the heavy sigh the raised eyebrow and the rhetorical flourish. At one point on “The Dick Cavett Show” Baldwin tangles with Paul Weiss a Yale philosophy professor who scolds him for dwelling so much on racial issues. The initial spectacle of mediocrity condescending to genius is painful but the subsequent triumph of   brilliance over credentialed ignorance is thrilling to witness. In that exchange as in a speech for an audience of British university students you are aware of Baldwin’s profound weariness. He must explain himself  —   and also his country  —   again and again with what must have been sorely tested patience. When the students erupt in a standing ovation at the end of his remarks Baldwin looks surprised even flustered. You glimpse an aspect of his personality that was often evident in his writing: the vulnerable bright ambitious man thrust into a public role that was not always comfortable. “I want to be an honest man and a good writer” he wrote early in his career in the introductory note to his first collection of essays “Notes of a Native Son. ” The disarming intimate candor of that statement characterized much of what would follow as would a reckoning with the difficulties of living up to such apparently straightforward aspirations. Without sliding into confessional bathos his voice was always personal and frank creating in the reader a feeling of complicity of shared knowledge and knowing humor. “I Am Not Your Negro” reproduces and redoubles this effect. It doesn’t just make you aware of Baldwin or hold him up as a figure to be admired from a distance. You feel entirely in his presence hanging on his every word following the implications of his ideas as they travel from his experience to yours. At the end of the movie you are convinced that you know him. And more important that he knows you. To read Baldwin is to be read by him to feel the glow of his affection the sting of his scorn the weight of his disappointment the gift of his trust. Recounting his visits to the South where he reported on the civil rights movement and the murderous white response to it Baldwin modestly described himself as a witness a watchful presence on the sidelines of tragedy and heroism an outsider by virtue of his Northern origins his sexuality and his alienation from the Christianity of his childhood. But he was also a prophet able to see the truths revealed by the contingent complicated actions of ordinary people on both sides of the conflict. This is not to say that he transcended the struggle or detached himself from it. On the contrary he demonstrated that writing well and thinking clearly are manifestations of commitment and that irony skepticism and a ruthless critical spirit are necessary tools for effective moral and political action. “I Am Not Your Negro” is a thrilling introduction to his work a remedial course in American history and an advanced seminar in racial politics  —   a concise roughly   movie with the scope and impact of a     or a literary doorstop. It is not an easy or a consoling movie but it is the opposite of bitter or despairing. “I can’t be a pessimist because I’m alive” Baldwin said. “I’m forced to be an optimist. ”"~e9a01a731e2579a86eef324b41e146d5dea33d06
"Musing in his Captain’s Log as his birthday approaches James Tiberius Kirk his eyes as blue as the lens flare that accompanies the first shot of the Starship Enterprise finds himself in a funk. “Things are starting to feel a little   …     episodic” he confesses in what even a sympathetic viewer might interpret as a   a confession of franchise fatigue. Chris Pine who has played Kirk since the   reboot in 2009 is on his third voyage. This character originated by William Shatner has endured a lot more. The larger “Star Trek” enterprise has been boldly going on for a   and more hours of television and cinema than I possess the Googling acumen to tally. So you can understand why James T. a good soldier and also a bit of a loose cannon might want to break out of the rut and the title of the latest movie “Star Trek Beyond” teases the audience with the promise of novelty and risk. It’s not necessarily a criticism to note that not much materializes. Directed by the action maven Justin Lin from a script by Simon Pegg and Doug Jung the film answers the question “Beyond what?” with a diffident “Well nothing really. Don’t worry!” It should have been called “Star Trek Within” in honor of its determination to color inside the lines obeying the ironclad conventions of brand and genre. Which is not in itself a bad thing. Not every wheel needs reinventing and one of the abiding pleasures of “Star Trek” in its old and newer iterations lies in its balance of stubborn consistency and canny inventiveness. The characters never change but the stakes can shift wildly from one adventure to the next. Fans love “Star Trek” precisely because of its episodic nature which allows for a certain amount of variation in theme and tone. Sometimes the future of the universe hangs in the balance. Sometimes Kirk and his crew have to deal with local disputes and personnel issues. Or weird random stuff like tribbles or Joan   time travel. Unfortunately     action movies are made according to a more rigid template and “Beyond” follows its immediate predecessors “Star Trek” and “Into Darkness” (both directed by J. J. Abrams) in sacrificing some of the old spirit to blockbuster imperatives. The Hollywood rule book stipulates that the climactic sequence should involve the noisy destruction of a lot of buildings and an extended    fight between the good guy and the main villain. The villain should be motivated by the usual villainous grudge. Millions of lives should be in danger and the actual casualties should be numerous and filmed bloodlessly enough to preserve the   rating. Up until the tedious and bombastic finish though you can have a pretty good time. In his work on the “Fast and Furious” movies Mr. Lin has shown a playful willingness to extend  —   and if necessary suspend  —   the laws of physics and his visual brashness can be a refreshing antidote to Mr. Abrams’s fussy tries to combine digital spectacle with   cinematic discipline. Most important the gang’s all here and Mr. Lin proves once again to be an adept ensemble wrangler. Kirk grins and grimaces his way through yet another existential career crisis (and also does some motorcycle stunt driving). Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) experience some love trouble. Spock and Bones (Karl Urban) take their   vaudeville double act on the road once again. Sulu (John Cho) Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and Scotty (Mr. Pegg) provide technical support and comic relief as necessary. Mr. Yelchin’s sweet mischievous performance seems especially poignant after his death in an accident this year. The film is dedicated to his memory and to the memory of Leonard Nimoy the original Mr. Spock who died in 2015. On the surface of a distant planet the crew encounters a new nemesis and a new ally. The big baddie is a murderous warlord named Krall (Idris Elba masked). The scrappy sidekick is a stranded fighter named Jaylah (Sofia Boutella in   makeup). Things go more or less as you expect with enough surprises and “reveals” to make you mad at me if I say too much more. The crew hops into and out of danger. Machinery fails and is repaired in the nick of time. Highly complicated imaginary science is explained with breathless urgency. Sometimes I have to say the scientific breakthroughs feel a little too convenient. Jaylah has some kind of technology that makes giant spaceships invisible and another kind that shoots   resin (or something). And there is some business at the end on an enormous space station that I did not buy for a minute. The nerd in me wants a bit more rigor a bit more plausibility underneath the exuberant fakery. Maybe in the next episode. “Star Trek Beyond” is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned). Nothing out of the ordinary. Running time: 2 hours."~c4b3bd2a6f5797609a66e6f9e154246b1db104f1
"“Morris From America” Chad Hartigan’s charming new film begins with a   discussion of   an argument about beats flows and hooks. It’s partly an affectionate intergenerational dispute    Morris (Markees Christmas) is skeptical of his father’s   dogma while his dad Curtis (Craig Robinson) dismisses his son’s taste as too pop. The conversation also provides a clue about the movie’s own strategies. It’s a pop confection with a rough honest texture real but not raw and suffused with an infectious sweetness that lingers after the final shot. As Curtis puts it he and Morris are “the only brothers in Heidelberg” an   family in the perplexing and sometimes unfriendly environment of a picturesque German town. Curtis a former soccer player in the United States is on the coaching staff of the local team and the rest of his back story is conveniently blurry. Like almost every other single dad you see in a movie he is a widower a shortcut to audience sympathy that Mr. Hartigan might have had the wit to avoid. But the novelty of the setting and the familiarity of the premise  —   an adolescent boy navigating a bumpy stretch on the road from boyhood to maturity  —   combine to give “Morris From America” buoyancy and heart. Mr. Christmas is an unusually subtle actor for someone his age. (He was 15 when the film was made.) He resists the temptation to make Morris precocious or cute or to win over the viewer’s sympathy and instead takes us inside the young man’s confusion. Like other teenagers Morris is both smart and clueless equally capable of sharp insights and colossal errors of judgment. Adding to his befuddlement is Katrin (Lina Keller) a slightly older girl (with a significantly older boyfriend) whom Morris meets at the youth center. He’s been encouraged to go there by his German tutor Inka (Carla Juri) who serves somewhat awkwardly as his   and surrogate big sister. Katrin a cynical and capricious queen bee is beautiful and more than a little cruel. She genuinely likes Morris which means that she likes to humiliate and torment him. She encourages him to rap at the center’s talent show with disastrous results. “Morris From America” is blunt about German racism which has a different texture from its American variety partly because young   Germans consider themselves entirely free of ancestral bigotry. A counselor at the youth center suspects that Morris is a drug dealer. The other kids blithely give voice to obnoxious assumptions about his basketball skills and his sexual prowess. He’s either a mascot or a scapegoat. Without minimizing the pain and injustice of Morris’s situation Mr. Hartigan whose previous features as a director are “This Is Martin Bonner” and “Erin and Brie Are on a First Date” handles the film’s racial dimensions with a gentle touch. The movie’s most satisfying achievement is its sense of proportion. There is plenty of drama in a teenager’s everyday life  —   no need to sensationalize  —   and “Morris From America” feels true to both the pleasures and the frustrations of its title character. And let’s not forget about Curtis. Mr. Robinson who has long been a stalwart supporting player in   and   comedies has my vote for father of the year. If there is anything harder than being a    boy it’s living with one and Mr. Robinson and Mr. Hartigan nail the particular challenges of that condition as well as anyone I can think of. Curtis who has his own emotional and professional needs must juggle an expanding number of conflicting duties. He’s supposed to be a role model and a pal to set limits and set his son free to leave the boy alone and to be there when he’s required. Morris and Curtis live in a state of mutual bewilderment but the love between them is the beat that drives the movie’s flow. The authenticity of some of the rapping means that “Morris From America” has an R rating but if you know someone Morris’s age and swearing is not a   for you this is a perfect movie to see together as the new school year approaches. “Morris From America” is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Explicit lyrics. Running time: 1 hour 31 minutes."~08aef9569eebe65c573886843a6879eaa673e72a
2"“Irresistible” is one of those adjectives that critics should handle with utmost care. No matter how universally charming or winning a movie or a performance might seem to be there is always a chance that somebody somewhere will be able to resist it. For all I know that may be the case with “Queen of Katwe” but if there is anyone out there capable of remaining unmoved by this       sports story I don’t think I want to meet that person. To be fair the film directed by Mira Nair based on Tim Crothers’s book and enabled by the magical corporate synergy of Disney and ESPN belongs to a genre that specializes in defeating skepticism and swelling the stoniest hearts. Just as surely as a creaky door or a clap of thunder will summon shivers of fright the thousandth time you hear it so will the spectacle of a scrappy group of strivers following their unlikely coach to victory bring lumps to throats and tears to eyes. Did “Hoosiers” make you cry? “Queen of Katwe” will wreck you. Katwe is a poor township outside of Kampala the Ugandan capital and it is the hometown of Phiona Mutesi a chess prodigy played by Madina Nalwanga in her film debut. Phiona lives with three siblings under the watchful tired eye of their mother Nakku Harriet (Lupita Nyong’o) who has lost her husband and another child and who scratches out a living selling food on the street. The family never has enough money and Uganda is depicted as a country of stark inequalities ruled by an unforgiving cash economy. Shelter schooling medical treatment and transportation to the hospital after an accident must be paid for up front. Harriet her mouth a permanent frown is nearly consumed by worry and fatigue. Her eldest daughter Night (Taryn Kyaze) has taken up with an unsavory guy on a motorbike. The middle children Phiona and her younger brother Brian (Martin Kabanza) scarcely have enough to eat. Chess enters their world thanks to Robert Katende (David Oyelowo) who teaches the game to Katwe’s children as part of a youth ministry. Robert whose own youth was scarred by poverty and war has an engineering degree but lacks the connections that would help land him a job working for the government or a private company. He is an inspiring coach  —   when Mr. Oyelowo wants to inspire you you are darn well going to be inspired  —   and also a sly and cheerful class warrior. He   his way into a chess tournament held at a snooty private school and proudly leads his charges into battle against opponents who are reluctant to shake their hands. The sight of     schoolboys beaten by a girl  —   a poor girl at that  —   would be satisfying even if “Queen of Katwe” were a less vivid and engaging movie. In Ms. Nair’s hands Phiona’s story has a richness and unpredictability that separates it from other superficially similar movies. It also has the buoyant cleareyed feel for the particulars of culture and place that is among this director’s great gifts evident in films as different as “Mississippi Masala” “Monsoon Wedding” and “Vanity Fair. ” Phiona’s circumstances are harsh and the film hardly minimizes the brutal choices and painful limitations placed on women like Harriet and Night. Nor does it suggest that winning chess matches is a magical solution to the world’s injustice. “Hope is not a tactic” Robert likes to say. But despair is not a strategy and Ms. Nair and the screenwriter William Wheeler refuse to turn African life into a pageant of grimness and deprivation. “Queen of Katwe” is likely to be embraced by young viewers and there is nothing here they won’t be able to handle. Adults meanwhile can surrender to some   melodramatic pleasures as the busy plot takes in Harriet and Robert’s struggles as well as Phiona’s. But in the end it is Ms. Nalwanga who will rivet all eyes in the way that untrained naturally charismatic screen performers sometimes can especially when supported by actors with the technical expertise of Ms. Nyong’o and Mr. Oyelowo. Ms. Nalwanga’s watchful quiet presence conveys both shyness and determination a habit of humility in tension with an almost superhuman intelligence. Phiona’s awakening sense of her talent is the engine that drives the main plot of “Queen of Katwe” and also what makes it an affecting character study. When she starts to learn chess she can barely read and her growing awareness of the powers of her mind is thrilling to watch. Ms. Nair makes this process as visible as palpable  —   as irresistible  —   as any boxing match or soccer game. “Queen of Katwe” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A few scary moments and hints of sexuality. Running time: 2 hours 4 minutes."~17a0cea32d4a9a2d34b2a08cc71c5c2c997012fa
